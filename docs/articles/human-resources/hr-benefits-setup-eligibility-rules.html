<h1 id="configure-eligibility-rules-and-options">Configure eligibility rules and options</h1>

<p>After you've configured the necessary parameters for Benefits management in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources, you can create eligibility rules, bundles, periods, and programs that you will associate with your benefit plans.</p>
<h2 id="create-an-eligibility-rule">Create an eligibility rule</h2>
<p>Eligibility rules define which employees can enroll in each benefit plan. After you define eligibility rules, you assign them to benefit plans. Then you can process enrollment eligibility to see which employees are eligible for each plan.</p>
<p>During open enrollment, employees can select benefit plans. If they become ineligible for a benefit plan based on eligibility rules after they are already enrolled, they aren’t automatically unenrolled. Typically, when a life event occurs that affects plan eligibility, an enrollment period is initiated for the employee to select plans that they are eligible for.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the <strong>Benefits management</strong> workspace, under <strong>Setup</strong>, select <strong>Eligibility rules and options</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Eligibility rules</strong> tab, select <strong>New</strong> to create an eligibility rule. To see plans that are associated with an eligibility rule, select <strong>Attached plans</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="configure-bundles">Configure bundles</h2>
<p>Bundles are a set of related benefit plans. You can use benefits bundles to group benefit plans that an employee must choose in order to enroll in certain benefit plans that may be dependent on other benefit plan enrollments. Examples of when you might want to use a bundle include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A health plan bundle that includes high-deductible health insurance with an associated health savings account (HSA).</p>
</li>
<li><p>A life insurance plan with a mandatory employee life insurance plan bundled with a dependent life plan. This would ensure an employee can't select dependent life coverage without signing up for the employee coverage.</p>
