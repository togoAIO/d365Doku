<h2 id="unable-to-add-an-attachment-to-an-approved-leave-request-to-resubmit-425407">Unable to add an attachment to an approved leave request to resubmit (425407)</h2>
<p>This change now allows attachments to approved leave requests.</p>
<h2 id="user-can-enter-compensation-for-an-employee-in-a-different-legal-entity-form-409529">User can enter compensation for an employee in a different legal entity form (409529)</h2>
<p>This change disables compensation options to prevent inadvertent entry of compensation records for the wrong legal entity.</p>
<h2 id="error-when-you-transfer-an-employee-and-the-worker-position-assignment-date-is-before-the-position-duration-429402">Error when you transfer an employee and the Worker position assignment date is before the position duration (429402)</h2>

<h2 id="attachments-capabilities-in-employee-self-service-benefits-enrollment">Attachments capabilities in Employee self service benefits enrollment</h2>
<p>Now you can add attachments during the benefits enrollment process for each plan that the employee's enrolling in. You can then view the attachments within the <strong>Worker enrolled benefit</strong> form.</p>
<h2 id="in-preview">In preview</h2>
<h2 id="human-resources-application-in-teams">Human Resources application in Teams</h2>
<p>Employees can view and request time away from work within Microsoft Teams. They can interact with a bot to create leave requests. For more information, see <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2127841">Human Resources app in Teams</a>.</p>
<h2 id="leave-suspension">Leave suspension</h2>
<p>You can suspend leave and absence in Human Resources for an employee. Suspending leave stops the leave accruals for selected leave types. If the suspension occurs after an accrual has been processed, suspending leave creates a prorated adjustment to the employee's leave balance. For more information, see <a href="hr-leave-and-absence-suspend-leave.html">Suspend leave</a>.</p>
<h2 id="update-user-experience-to-indicate-that-accrual-is-suspended-429550">Update user experience to indicate that accrual is suspended (429550)</h2>

<h2 id="buy-and-sell-leave-in-preview-june-1">Buy and sell leave (in preview June 1)</h2>
<p>Some organizations provide a benefit that allows employees to buy or sell their leave. This process is often managed manually. This feature provides a more automated way to manage policies and requests for the HR department, and it helps eliminate mistakes while streamlining the leave management process. For more information, see:</p>
