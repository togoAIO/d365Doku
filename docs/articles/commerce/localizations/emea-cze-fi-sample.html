<h1 id="fiscal-registration-service-integration-sample-for-czech-republic">Fiscal registration service integration sample for Czech Republic</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>To meet local fiscal requirements for cash registers in the Czech Republic, the Dynamics 365 Commerce functionality for the Czech Republic includes a sample integration of the point of sale (POS) with an external fiscal registration service. The sample extends the <a href="fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.html">fiscal integration functionality</a>. It's based on the <a href="https://efsta.org/sicherheitsloesungen/">EFR (Electronic Fiscal Register)</a> solution from <a href="https://efsta.org/">EFSTA</a> and enables communication with the EFR service via the HTTPS protocol. The EFR service ensures Electronic Registration of Sales (EET - Elektronická evidence tržeb), that is, the online transmission of the sales data to a fiscal web service of tax authorities.</p>
<p>The EFR service should be hosted on either the Commerce Hardware station or a separate machine that can be connected to from the Hardware station. The sample is provided in the form of source code and is part of the Retail software development kit (SDK).</p>
<p>Microsoft doesn't release any hardware, software, or documentation from EFSTA. For information about how to get the EFR solution and operate it, contact <a href="https://efsta.org/kontakt/">EFSTA</a>.</p>
<h2 id="scenarios">Scenarios</h2>
<p>The following scenarios are covered by the fiscal registration service integration sample for the Czech Republic.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Registration of cash transactions in the fiscal registration service.</p>
<ul>
<li>Send detailed transaction data to the fiscal registration service. This data includes sales line information, and information about discounts, payments, and taxes. The fiscal registration service further sends the data to the web-service of tax authorities and receives a confirmation from it that includes the fiscal identification code of the transaction.</li>
<li>Capture a response from the fiscal registration service. This response includes fiscal data such as the fiscal identification code and the security code of the transaction, etc.</li>
<li>Print the fiscal data for a registered transaction on the receipt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Registration of gift card operations and customer deposits in the fiscal registration service.</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue or add money to a gift card.</li>
<li>Register a customer account deposit.</li>
<li>Create a customer order and register a deposit for the order.</li>
<li>Edit a customer order and override the deposit for the order.</li>
<li>Cancel a customer order and refund the deposit for the order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Error handling, such as the following options.</p>
<ul>
<li>Retry fiscal registration if a retry is possible, such as if the fiscal registration service isn't available, isn't ready, or isn't responding.</li>
<li>Postpone fiscal registration.</li>
<li>Skip fiscal registration, or mark the transaction as registered, and include info codes to capture the reason for the failure and additional information.</li>
<li>Check the availability of the fiscal registration service before a new sales transaction is opened or a sales transaction is finalized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="default-data-mapping">Default data mapping</h3>
<p>The following default data mapping is included in the fiscal document provider configuration that is provided as part of the fiscal integration sample.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Value-added tax (VAT) rates mapping:</p>
<p><em>A: 21.00; B: 15.00; C: 10.00; Z: 0.00</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Default VAT group mapping. Any VAT amounts that cannot be mapped to one of the predetermined VAT groups will be attributed to the default (basic) VAT group:</p>
<p><em>A</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Deposit VAT group mapping. Customer deposit amounts and customer order deposit amounts will be attributed to the deposit VAT group:</p>
<p><em>Z</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gift-cards">Gift cards</h3>
<p>The fiscal registration service integration sample implements the following rules that are related to gift cards.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales lines that are related to the <em>Issue gift card</em> or <em>Add to gift card</em> operations in a sales transaction are marked with a special attribute when the transaction is registered in the fiscal registration service.</li>
<li>A payment by gift card is considered a regular payment and marked with a special attribute when the transaction is registered in the fiscal registration service.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="customer-account-deposits-and-customer-order-deposits">Customer account deposits and customer order deposits</h3>
<p>The fiscal registration service integration sample implements the following rules that are related to customer account deposits and customer order deposits.</p>
<ul>
<li>A transaction that is related to a customer account deposit or a customer order deposit is registered in the fiscal registration service as a single line transaction and is marked with a special attribute. The deposit VAT group is specified in this line.</li>
<li>When a hybrid customer order is created, that is, a customer order that contains products that can be carried out of the store by the customer, as well as products that will be picked up or shipped later, the transaction registered in the fiscal registration service contains lines for the products that are carried out, as well as a line for the order deposit.</li>
<li>A payment from a customer account is considered a regular payment and marked with a special attribute when the transaction is registered in the fiscal registration service.</li>
<li>The customer order deposit amount that is applied to a customer order <em>Pick up</em> operation is considered a regular payment and marked with a special attribute when the transaction is registered in the fiscal registration service.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="offline-registration">Offline registration</h3>
<p>If the fiscal registration service fails to transmit transaction data to the fiscal web service of tax authorities (e.g. due to the response timeout) and to receive a confirmation from the web-service (that is, the fiscal identification code of the transaction), it generates a local signature for the transaction and includes it and a special error code in the response. The fiscal registration service resends transactions in original order in background as soon as the network connection is restored.</p>
<h3 id="limitations-of-the-sample">Limitations of the sample</h3>
<p>The fiscal registration service supports only scenarios where sales tax is included in the price. Therefore, the <strong>Price include sales tax</strong> option must be set to <strong>Yes</strong> for both stores and customers.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-commerce-for-czech-republic">Set up Commerce for Czech Republic</h2>
<p>This section describes the Commerce settings that are specific to and recommended for the Czech Republic. For more information, see <a href="../index.html">Commerce home page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="design-of-extensions">Design of extensions</h2>
<h3 id="commerce-runtime-extension-design">Commerce runtime extension design</h3>
<p>The purpose of the extension that is a fiscal document provider is to generate service-specific documents and handle responses from the fiscal registration service.</p>
<p>The CRT extension is <strong>Runtime.Extensions.DocumentProvider.EFRSample</strong>.</p>
<p>For more details about the design of the fiscal integration solution, see <a href="fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.html#fiscal-registration-process-and-fiscal-integration-samples-for-fiscal-devices">Fiscal registration process and fiscal integration samples for fiscal devices</a>.</p>
<h4 id="request-handler">Request handler</h4>
<p>There is a single <strong>DocumentProviderEFRFiscalCZE</strong> request handler for document provider, which is used to generate fiscal documents for the fiscal registration service.</p>
<p>This handler is inherited from the <strong>INamedRequestHandler</strong> interface. The <strong>HandlerName</strong> method is responsible for returning the name of the handler. The handler name should match the connector document provider name that is specified in Headquarters.</p>
<p>The connector supports the following requests.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GetFiscalDocumentDocumentProviderRequest</strong> – This request contains information about what document should be generated. It returns a service-specific document that should be registered in the fiscal registration service.</li>
<li><strong>GetSupportedRegistrableEventsDocumentProviderRequest</strong> – This request returns the list of events to subscribe to. Currently, the following events are supported: sales, customer account deposits and customer order deposits.</li>
<li><strong>GetFiscalRegisterResponseToSaveDocumentProviderRequest</strong> – This request returns the response from the fiscal registration service. This response is serialized to form a string so that it's ready to be saved.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="configuration">Configuration</h4>
<p>The <strong>DocumentProviderFiscalEFRSampleCzech</strong> configuration file is located in the <strong>Configuration</strong> folder of the extension project.
The purpose of this file is to enable settings for the document provider to be configured from Headquarters. The file format is aligned with the requirements for fiscal integration configuration. The following settings are added.</p>
<ul>
<li>VAT rates mapping</li>
<li>Default VAT group</li>
<li>Deposit VAT group</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hardware-station-extension-design">Hardware station extension design</h3>
<p>The purpose of the extension that is a fiscal connector is to communicate with the fiscal registration service.</p>
<p>The Hardware station extension is <strong>HardwareStation.Extension.EFRSample</strong>. The Hardware station extension uses the HTTP protocol to submit documents that the CRT extension generates to the fiscal registration service. It also handles the responses that are received from the fiscal registration service.</p>
<h4 id="request-handler-1">Request handler</h4>
<p>The <strong>EFRHandler</strong> request handler is the entry point for handling requests to the fiscal registration service.</p>
<p>The handler is inherited from the <strong>INamedRequestHandler</strong> interface. The <strong>HandlerName</strong> method is responsible for returning the name of the handler. The handler name should match the fiscal connector name that is specified in Headquarters.</p>
<p>The connector supports the following requests.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SubmitDocumentFiscalDeviceRequest</strong> – This request sends documents to the fiscal registration service and returns a response from it.</li>
<li><strong>IsReadyFiscalDeviceRequest</strong> – This request is used for a health check of the fiscal registration service.</li>
<li><strong>InitializeFiscalDeviceRequest</strong> – This request is used to initialize the fiscal registration service.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="configuration-1">Configuration</h4>
<p>The configuration file is located in the <strong>Configuration</strong> folder of the extension project. The purpose of the file is to enable settings for the fiscal connector to be configured from Headquarters. The file format is aligned with the requirements for fiscal integration configuration. The following settings are added.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Endpoint address</strong> – The URL of the fiscal registration service.</li>
<li><strong>Timeout</strong> – The amount of time, in milliseconds, that the driver will wait for a response from the fiscal registration service.</li>
</ul>
