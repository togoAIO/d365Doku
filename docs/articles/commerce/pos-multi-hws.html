<h1 id="dedicated-payment-terminals-and-prompts-for-a-printer-and-cash-drawer">Dedicated payment terminals and prompts for a printer and cash drawer</h1>


<p>This topic provides information about the capability to have a dedicated payment terminal and prompt the user to select a cash drawer and a receipt printer.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Modern retailers are searching for ways to streamline the in-store checkout experience. Recent trends toward paperless checkout through electronic payments not only help to make the purchasing experience smoother but also reduce the need to have a full complement of peripheral devices available for every store associate.</p>
<p>Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce supports these trends by enabling a scenario where a point of sale (POS) device has a dedicated payment terminal assigned to it all the time, but it doesn't have its own receipt printer or cash drawer. When associates must print a receipt or take a cash payment, they are prompted to select a hardware station where those devices are configured.</p>

<h2 id="supported-pos-clients-and-devices">Supported POS clients and devices</h2>
<p>The functionality that is described in this topic is supported by the Modern POS for Windows and Modern POS for Android POS clients.</p>
<p>This functionality supports network-enabled payment terminals and receipt printers. You can provide cash drawer support by connecting the cash drawer to the network-enabled receipt printer via the d/k port.</p>
<p>Out-of-box support for this functionality is provided by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/commerce/dev-itpro/adyen-connector?tabs=8-1-3">Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen</a>. However, other payment connectors might be supported via the Commerce software development kit (SDK) for payments. Supported receipt printers include network-enabled receipt printers from Star Micronics and Epson.</p>
<p>To set up Star Micronics receipt printers, use the Star Micronics Printer Utility to configure the device so that it can be used over the network. This utility will also provide the IP address of the device.</p>
<p>To set up Epson receipt printers, use the Epson ePOS-Print utility to set up the device to use network protocols.</p>
<p>For more information about how to set up network peripherals, see <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2129965">Network peripheral support overview</a>.</p>

<h3 id="set-up-hardware-profiles">Set up hardware profiles</h3>
<p>You must have two types of hardware profile. The first is assigned to the register. The second is assigned to a hardware station at the store level, and is used to logically group network receipt printers and cash drawers.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>New</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Assign a hardware profile number, and then enter a description. This hardware profile will be assigned to the register itself. Therefore, a description such as <strong>Dedicated with fallback</strong> will suffice.</p>

<li>Sign in, and then select <strong>Non-drawer drawer operations</strong>.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Manage hardware stations</strong> operation to turn on a hardware station.</li>
<li>Select the hardware station that you created for the register to make it active.</li>
<li>Sign out of the POS, sign back in, and open a shift.</li>
</ol>
<p>The payment terminal that is assigned to the hardware profile will now always be active, and you will be prompted if a receipt printer or cash drawer is required.</p>
<p>Many merchants who requested this feature are interested in reducing waste by providing email receipts and encouraging electronic payments. Depending on the configuration of the POS, store associates are prompted to select a receipt printer or cash drawer only when a customer wants a physical receipt or wants to pay with cash.</p>
<p>Store associates are prompted to select a hardware station only one time per transaction, unless a receipt must be printed and cash is used for payment, but the hardware profile that was originally selected doesn't include both devices. In that case, the store associate will be prompted again to select a hardware station that can be used to complete the transaction.</p>
