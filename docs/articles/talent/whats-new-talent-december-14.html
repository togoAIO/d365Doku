<h1 id="whats-new-or-changed-in-dynamics-365-talent---core-hr-december-14-2018">What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 Talent - Core HR (December 14, 2018)</h1>

[!include[rename-banner](~/includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]
<p><strong>Build 8.1.2085</strong></p>
<p>This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Core HR.</p>
<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>
<h3 id="us---aca-affordable-care-act-support-for-tax-year-2018-1095-b-and-1095-c-forms">US - ACA (Affordable Care Act) support for tax year 2018 1095-B and 1095-C forms</h3>
<p>Each year, Applicable Large Employers (ALEs) must provide each full-time employees with a 1095-C. In addition, if the employer provides self-insured coverage they must provide the 1095-C (if they are an ALE) and a 1095-B (if they are a small employer) to any employee, full-time or part-time, covered under one of their offered health plans. This feature provides printable forms for both the 1095-C and 1095-B.</p>
<h3 id="during-import-submittedbypersonid-column-on-hcmperfjournalentity-is-ignored">During import SubmittedByPersonId column on HcmPerfJournalEntity is ignored</h3>
<p>When importing/exporting performance journal entries, the <strong>Submitted by</strong> column is ignored. With this change, the value <strong>imported/exported</strong> will reflect the value in the table during the export, when importing the system will be updated with the value supplied in the import file.</p>
<h3 id="analytics-tab-on-leave-and-absence-workspace-displays-openconnectionerror-error-for-non-system-admin-roles">Analytics tab on 'Leave and absence' workspace displays &quot;OpenConnectionError&quot; error for non-system Admin roles</h3>
<p>With this update, no errors will be issued when opening the <strong>Analytics</strong> tab on the <strong>Leave and Absence</strong> workspace.</p>
<h3 id="employee-self-service-position-hierarchy-drill-down-from-tile-fails-to-get-parent-node">Employee self-service, Position Hierarchy drill-down from tile fails to get parent node</h3>
<p>A change has been made to correct the error &quot;Getting the parent node failed&quot; when the position hierarchy has been personalized to appear on an existing workspace and a position is selected in the hierarchy.</p>
<h3 id="must-be-system-admin-to-see-the-payroll-tab-in-the-position-page">Must be System Admin to see the Payroll tab in the Position page</h3>
<p>A change has been made to include the correct security elements in the existing privilege: &quot;Maintain payroll worker and position detail&quot;. With this change, by default, the Payroll Administrator will have access to the Payroll columns on the Position page.</p>
<h3 id="error-when-submitting-performance-review-to-manager-and-the-reviewsperfperiod-placeholder-is-used-in-the-submission-instructions">Error when submitting performance review to manager and the %Reviews.PerfPeriod% placeholder is used in the Submission instructions</h3>
<p>A change has been made that corrects the &quot;Null Reference&quot; error when using the %Reviews.PerfPeriod% placeholder in the Submission instructions.</p>
<h3 id="workforce-power-bi-report-shows-error-when-worker-seniority-date-is-a-leap-day">Workforce Power BI report shows error when worker seniority date is a leap day</h3>
<p>With this change, leap days are now supported in Power BI.</p>
<h3 id="integration-between-core-hr-and-attract">Integration between Core HR and Attract</h3>
<p>A change has been made to update the integration between Core HR and Attract related to candidates to hire. For candidates to hire to be visible in the <strong>Personnel Management</strong> workspace, the following Dataverse tables are used:</p>
<p>Job Application</p>
<ul>
<li>Status Reason needs to be set to Offer Accepted</li>
<li>Provides Candidate and Job Opening</li>
</ul>
<p>Candidate</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides Candidate information</li>
</ul>
<p>Job Opening</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides Job Opening ID and Job Opening Participants</li>
</ul>
<p>Job Opening Participants</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides Hiring Manager</li>
</ul>
<p>When a candidate is added to Personnel Management, the candidate can now also be dismissed using a new option available on the candidate card.</p>
<h2 id="coming-soon">Coming soon</h2>
<h3 id="leave-and-absence-future-leave-and-forecasting-leave-balances">Leave and absence: Future leave and forecasting leave balances</h3>
<p>With the changes being made to allow for employees to forecast time off and request future time off requests without impacting their current time off balances, the way the time off balances are displayed is also changing.</p>
<p>The available balance currently displayed is the amount of time off available for requests including accruals through today and all approved leave requests to the end of time.</p>
<p>When the ability to forecast is released, the balance displayed changes to  be the current balance of time off including accruals through today and requests through today. Employees and managers will see these updated balances in employee and manager self-service on the <strong>Time off</strong> card and in the <strong>Time off balances</strong> window. HR managers will see these updated balances in the <strong>People</strong> workspace and in the employee’s <strong>Assigned leave plans</strong> window.</p>
<h2 id="known-issue">Known issue</h2>
<h3 id="mapping-errors-in-the-integration-with-finance">Mapping errors in the integration with Finance</h3>
<p>The following issues have been identified in the current template for integrating Talent with Dynamics 365 Finance.

Refer to the following table for updated mappings.</p>
