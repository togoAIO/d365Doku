<h1 id="set-up-garnishments-and-tax-levies">Set up garnishments and tax levies</h1>


<p>This topic explains how to set up garnishments and tax levies. Garnishments and tax levies are created and managed by using the benefit framework. This framework helps guarantee that the effect that garnishments and tax levies have on payroll is handled correctly.</p>
<p>If you have questions about garnishments that aren't answered in this topic, or in <a href="noam-usa-garnishment-tax-levy-enrollment-tasks.html">Enroll workers in garnishments or tax levies</a> or <a href="noam-usa-garnishment-tax-levy-administrative-fees.html">Garnishments, tax levies, and administrative fees FAQ</a>, contact your legal advisor. Here is a summary of each step in the process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Set up disposable income definitions.</strong> When the court imposes an order to garnish a worker's wages, the actual amount of the garnishment is limited to a percentage of the worker's disposable income. The federal definition of disposable income is built into the payroll calculation. However, some states require additional reductions to disposable income. You can use disposable income definitions to identify those reductions and help guarantee that the correct earnings and deductions are included when the worker's disposable income is calculated.</li>
<li><strong>Set up benefit elements for garnishments, tax levies, and administrative fees.</strong> Because garnishments and tax levies are processed as benefits, each garnishment or tax levy consists of a benefit type, plan, and option. Together, these elements create a single instance of a garnishment or tax levy. Administrative fees aren't permitted in every state. Even in states where administrative fees are permitted, they are never mandatory. Your organization must decide whether to charge them.</li>
<li><strong>Create benefits for garnishments, tax levies, and administrative fees.</strong> You must have at least one benefit for garnishments and at least one benefit for tax levies. If a worker has more than one garnishment of the same type, you must have more than one garnishment benefit of that type. If your organization charges an administrative fee for handling garnishments and tax levies, you must have at least one benefit for the fee. You can also optionally have additional benefits for other administrative fees.</li>
</ol>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>In this topic, the term <em>garnishment</em> implies both garnishments and tax levies, unless the text specifies otherwise. For more information about the concepts that are discussed in this topic, see <a href="noam-usa-garnishment-tax-levy-administrative-fees.html">Garnishments, tax levies, and administrative fees FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-disposable-income-definitions">Setting up disposable income definitions</h2>
<p>When the court imposes an order to garnish a worker's wages, the actual amount of the garnishment is limited to a percentage of the worker's disposable income. Under the federal definition, the disposable income is determined by subtracting all deductions that are required by law from a worker's gross earnings or income. Gross earnings include wages, commissions, bonuses, paid time off (PTO) pay, and periodic pension statements. Here are some of the deductions that are required by law:</p>
<ul>
<li>Federal, state, and local income tax</li>
<li>Social Security and Medicare tax</li>
<li>State unemployment or disability tax</li>
<li>State-mandated payments for state employee retirement systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the federal formula, voluntary deductions (for example, deductions for life insurance, union dues, and retirement plan contributions) aren't subtracted from earnings. The federal formula has been built into the Payroll system.</p>
<p>Many states use the federal definition of disposable income. However, some states have their own definition that exempts some additional earnings from total wages and subtracts other deductions, to further reduce what is considered disposable income. You don't have to create a definition by using the federal formula. (The federal formula is built into the Payroll calculations.) However, you must create additional disposable income definitions to comply with each state's formula.</p>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>State definitions are subject to change every year. Because it can be difficult to match your organization's earning codes and benefits to the definitions that are used by a specific state, we recommend that your legal advisors determine the earning codes and benefits that must be included in each disposable income definition. We also recommend that your legal advisors review the definitions every year.</p>
</div>
<p>When you create a disposable income definition, you specify the earnings and the benefits to reduce the worker's disposable income by. You don't have to specify the taxes. All mandatory taxes are automatically subtracted from the total wages.</p>
<p>Tax levies and other garnishments aren't automatically excluded from the worker's disposable income. To exclude them, you must specify them in the benefit section of the disposable income definition.</p>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>Disposable income definitions don't have date-effective versions. When you change a definition, the change takes effect immediately. Therefore, we recommend that you not change any existing disposable income definitions that you've used.</p>
</div>
<p>You create a new disposable income definition on the <strong>Disposable income definition</strong> page. Enter a name and description for the new disposable income definition. Because disposable income definitions are typically defined for each state, consider using the two-letter state abbreviation as the first two letters of the name of every disposable income definition. For example, when you create a disposable income definition for garnishments from Texas, enter a name that starts with <strong>TX</strong>. Then, when you receive a new garnishment order, you can quickly see whether you already have the required disposable income definition, or whether you must create it.</p>
<p>When total wages are calculated, earning lines that are designated by the earning code are excluded. Click the <strong>Add</strong> button above the <strong>Reduce total wages by the following earnings</strong> grid, and select an earning code that represents the earnings that the state has identified as exempt from disposable income.</p>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>It can be difficult to match your organization's earning codes to the definitions that a specific state uses. Therefore, we recommend that your legal advisors determine the earning codes that should be included in each disposable income definition.</p>
</div>
<p>When total wages are calculated, deductions for selected benefits are excluded. Click the <strong>Add</strong> button above the <strong>Reduce disposable income by deductions for the following benefits</strong> grid, and select benefits that the state has identified as exempt from disposable income. Remember that the system handles garnishments and tax levies as benefits. Therefore, to exclude the amount of garnishments or tax levies from a disposable income definition, you must add the garnishment or tax levy benefits here.</p>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>We recommend that you work with your legal advisors to determine the benefits that should be included in each disposable income definition.</p>
</div>
<p>If you delete an earning code or benefit, it's automatically removed from all disposable income definitions. New earning codes and benefits that you create aren't automatically added. When you maintain earning codes and benefits, you must consider the effect that any changes will have on the disposable income definitions.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-benefit-elements">Setting up benefit elements</h2>
<p>Garnishments and tax levies are handled as benefits. A benefit is a unique combination of a benefit type, plan, and option. Use this set of tasks to create the following benefit elements that are required in order to create garnishment and tax levy benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefit types</strong> – You must create two benefit types: one for garnishments and one for tax levies. If your organization charges administrative fees for garnishments and tax levies, you must also create a benefit type for the administrative fees.</li>
<li><strong>Benefit plans</strong> – Most organizations create a benefit plan for each type of garnishment and tax levy. You can create additional benefit plans. For example, you might create a separate benefit plan for tax levies from each state.</li>
<li><strong>Benefit options</strong> – When you create benefit options, we recommend that you create a set of numbered options for garnishments and tax levies. For example, you might create options 01, 02, and 03. By numbering the options in this manner, you can quickly see the order that the garnishments were entered in.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you set up the benefit elements for garnishments and tax levies, remember that multiple garnishments can be in effect for a worker at the same time, but the worker can have only one enrollment in each benefit at any time. Therefore, you must create multiple garnishment benefits. To create multiple garnishment benefits, you can set up multiple benefit plans or multiple benefit options. The easier method is to set up multiple benefit options, as described in the following set of tasks.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-benefit-types-for-garnishments-tax-levies-and-administrative-fees">Setting up benefit types for garnishments, tax levies, and administrative fees</h3>
<p>You set up benefit types for garnishments, tax levies, and administrative fees on the <strong>Benefit elements</strong> page. In the <strong>Type</strong> section of the <strong>Benefit elements</strong> page, enter the following information.</p>

<ul>
<li>Support order</li>
<li>Bankruptcy</li>
<li>Federal administrative</li>

<blockquote>[!IMPORTANT] Many states have laws that specify how garnishments for child support are handled when a worker receives a lump-sum payment, such as a bonus, severance pay, or a vacation payout. The laws vary, but they typically include a provision that the state must be notified before a lump-sum payment is made. The state then gives the employer specific instructions about whether to calculate the garnishment and how to calculate it. In some cases, the whole lump-sum payment is subject to garnishment.</blockquote>
