<h1 id="post-payroll-distributions-and-generate-vendor-invoices">Post payroll distributions and generate vendor invoices</h1>


<p>This topic walks you through the process for posting payroll distributions and generating the required vendor invoices.</p>
<p>When you post payroll, the accounting distributions that are specified on each pay statement line determine the offset accounts that are used. When each line has a balanced transaction, all transactions for the pay statement can be entered in the general ledger.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Offset accounts are determined by the posting definitions that are assigned to pay statements on the <strong>Transaction posting definitions</strong> page. When you post a pay statement, all lines must be successfully posted. Otherwise, no lines are posted. Similarly, when you post multiple pay statements, if one statement can't be posted, no pay statements are posted.</p>
</div>
<p>After you post payroll, you should generate vendor invoices for the payables that were generated from the pay period that you posted. This process combines the amounts from all the pay statements that were posted for the period, and uses the benefit and tax setup information to create an invoice for each vendor. The totals and their corresponding accounting distributions from the original pay statement lines are used to create the invoices.</p>
