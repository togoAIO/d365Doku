<p>This topic explains how to enter replies to a request for quotation (RFQ), score and compare bids, and then award the contract to one of the vendors. You can use this procedure in the <strong>USMF</strong> demo data company.</p>
<p>Before you start this procedure, you must have an RFQ that has two lines, and that has been sent to at least two vendors. To create this RFQ, complete the <a href="create-request-quotation.html">Create a request for quotation</a> procedure. Scoring criteria must also be set up before you can complete this procedure.</p>
<p>You can enter the bid as either a vendor or a procurement professional. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.wika.com/en-us/dynamics365/supply-chain/supply-chain/procurement/set-up-maintain-vendor-collaboration">Set up and maintain vendor collaboration (This is an external linThis link was changed due to HTMLfromRepoGenerator)</a>.</p>
