<hr>
<p>New vendors can be onboarded and registered as vendors in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, based on information that is collected from a person who represents the vendor.</p>
<p>The process consists of the following steps, where various roles perform actions in the system.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data management OData</strong> – Entity import - The initial request is the prospective vendor registration request. Typically, this request comes from a source such as a customer-hosted website that allows anonymous access. Vendors can sign up by providing basic information, such as the vendor name, justification, organization number, and name and email address of the contact person. The requests are imported via the Data management interface.</li>
<li><strong>Prospective vendor registration request list page</strong> - Based on the information that is provided in the prospective vendor registration request, a procurement professional decides whether the vendor should be onboarded. The procurement professional views the incoming request on the <strong>Prospective vendor registration requests</strong> list page.</li>
<li><strong>User provisioning workflow</strong> - When a procurement professional has verified the information in the incoming request and has decided to continue with the onboarding process, the user request workflow provisions the new user and sends an invitation email to accept the contact person as an authenticated user of Microsoft Dynamics 365.</li>
<li><strong>Vendor registration wizard</strong> - The vendor's contact person signs in by using the new user account. He or she completes a vendor registration wizard to provide information such as addresses, business information, procurement categories, and questionnaire responses.</li>
<li><strong>Approval workflow</strong> - A vendor request that includes the registration information is created. This vendor request is submitted to a workflow, and is routed for review and approval.</li>
<li><strong>Creation of a vendor master and user role modification</strong> - When the vendor request is approved, a vendor record is created. The user account of the vendor's contact person is either granted permission to vendor collaboration or inactivated.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following table shows the steps and roles that are involved in the process.</p>

<p>After the prospective vendor registration request is imported, it appears on the <strong>Prospective vendor registration request</strong> list page. From this list page, a procurement professional can invite the user. A user request for provisioning the user is sent to a workflow.</p>
<h2 id="submitting-a-prospective-vendor-user-request">Submitting a prospective vendor user request</h2>
<p>The purpose of a prospective vendor user request is to provision the person who submitted the initial request, so that he or she can sign in to Supply Chain Management by using the email account that is provided in the prospective vendor registration request.</p>
<p>The prospective vendor user request is processed by the user request workflow. This workflow communicates through Azure AD B2B collaboration. It creates a user in Supply Chain Management that has the appropriate security settings.</p>
<p>New users that are set up have the following security roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>System external user</li>
<li>Vendor prospective (external)</li>
</ul>
<p>The new user will receive an email that is generated by the user request workflow. This email invites the user to sign in to the system.</p>
<p>For information about the configuration of the email and the workflow in general, see the description of a user request workflow in <a href="https://docs.wika.com/en-us/dynamics365/supply-chain/supply-chain/procurement/set-up-maintain-vendor-collaboration">Set up and maintain vendor collaboration (This is an external linThis link was changed due to HTMLfromRepoGenerator)</a>.</p>
<h2 id="vendor-registration">Vendor registration</h2>
<p>A prospective vendor user who signs in to Supply Chain Management will see the first page of a vendor registration wizard, where he or she can enter vendor information.</p>
<p>The wizard reflects the configuration of the vendor request. The country or region where the vendor does business determines what information is requested in the wizard and what information is mandatory.</p>
<p>For more information about the vendor request configuration, see <a href="https://docs.wika.com/en-us/dynamics365/supply-chain/supply-chain/procurement/set-up-maintain-vendor-collaboration">Set up and maintain vendor collaboration (This is an external linThis link was changed due to HTMLfromRepoGenerator)</a>. The following table gives an overview of the pages in the wizard and the purpose of each page.</p>
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Country/region</td>
<td>The country or region determines the vendor request configuration that is applied on the remaining wizard pages. It also determines values in the <strong>Tax state</strong> lookup.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Terms and conditions</td>
<td>This page might be available, depending on the vendor request configuration. If it's available, the user must acknowledge the terms and conditions to continue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vendor information</td>
<td>This page contains the vendor name, which is automatically entered from the original prospective vendor registration request. It also contains the organization number, the vendor's telephone number, fax number, and email address, and the vendor's addresses for various purposes.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Questionnaires</td>
<td>The wizard might include a set of questionnaires for the vendor. Questionnaires that appear in the wizard are configured either on the vendor request or per procurement category. If questionnaires are configured per procurement category, the procurement categories that the vendor requests approval for determine the questionnaires that appear in the wizard. On the <strong>Procurement categories</strong> page, you can add a questionnaire under the relevant category and set the activity type to <strong>Vendor onboarding</strong>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When the prospective vendor user completes the vendor registration wizard, a vendor request is created.</p>
<h2 id="manually-or-automatically-submit-a-vendor-request">Manually or automatically submit a vendor request</h2>
<p>A vendor request can be created as a draft and manually submitted to a workflow. Alternatively, the vendor request can be automatically submitted to a workflow when the vendor registration wizard is completed. A request can be submitted manually if, for example, a procurement professional wants to assess whether the request should be routed through an approval process before it's submitted to the workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select <strong>Procurement and sourcing parameters</strong> &gt; <strong>Vendor collaboration</strong>, and then select <strong>Auto submit prospective vendor registration to workflow</strong> to configure the vendor request so that it's submitted automatically to a workflow when the vendor registration wizard is completed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vendor-requests">Vendor requests</h2>
<p>Vendor requests are available on the <strong>Vendor collaboration user requests</strong> page.</p>
<p>A vendor request contains the information that the prospective vendor user entered in the vendor registration wizard.</p>
<p>The request lets you review the vendor information and decide whether the vendor should become a registered vendor.</p>
<p>The vendor request should be submitted to a workflow, and it should be routed to the relevant reviewers and approvers. For basic information about how to set up workflows, see <a href="procurement-sourcing-workflows.html">Procurement and sourcing workflows</a>.</p>
<p>The following table shows the statuses that vendor requests can have.</p>
<table>
<thead>

If there is only one reviewer, that participant can complete the review by selecting <strong>Completed</strong> in the workflow action. He or she doesn't have to accept the work item first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Request pending approval</td>
<td>The vendor request has been routed to the participants for approval, and there is an option to request additional information. A request for additional information cause the work item to be routed back to the submitter. The vendor request can also be approved or rejected while it's in this status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Application change request</td>
<td>Additional information has been requested by the approver, and the vendor request has been routed to the person who submitted the vendor request.

<h2 id="approving-a-vendor-request">Approving a vendor request</h2>
<p>When a vendor request is approved, a vendor account is created, and the status <strong>Approved</strong> appears on both the initial prospective vendor registration request and the vendor request.</p>
<p>Before you approve a vendor request, on the <strong>New vendor</strong> page, on the <strong>General</strong> FastTab, select <strong>Vendor group</strong> to select a vendor group.</p>
<p>If the prospective vendor user should have access to Supply Chain Management as a vendor collaboration user who represents the vendor, set the vendor collaboration access permission to <strong>Yes</strong>. To inactivate the user account that the prospective vendor used to register, set this permission to <strong>No</strong>.</p>
<p>If the vendor collaboration access permission is set to <strong>Yes</strong>, when the vendor request is approved, a request is submitted to modify the user's roles so that the user has the roles that are defined for the <strong>Vendor</strong> type in <strong>External roles</strong>. If this permission is set to <strong>No</strong>, when the vendor request is approved, a request is submitted to inactivate the user. In this case, the workflow to inactivate a user request must be set up.</p>
<p>For a vendor account to be created when the vendor request is approved, the number sequence for creating vendors from vendor requests must be set to <strong>Auto</strong>.</p>
<p>For an overview of the access permissions of a vendor collaboration user, see <a href="https://docs.wika.com/en-us/dynamics365/supply-chain/supply-chain/procurement/set-up-maintain-vendor-collaboration">Set up and maintain vendor collaboration (This is an external linThis link was changed due to HTMLfromRepoGenerator)</a>.</p>
