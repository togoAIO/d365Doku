<p>This topic describes how to configure the menu items that warehouse workers use to perform work on a mobile device.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>This topic applies to features in Warehouse management. It doesn't apply to features in Inventory management. The menu items that appear on the menus on a warehouse mobile device are configured on the <strong>Mobile device menu items</strong> page. Because the menu items can be put onto different menus, it's easy to configure menu structures so that only specific types of work are exposed to specific users. You can configure menu items to perform the following tasks:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Process an inquiry or perform an activity, such as printing a label, generating license plate numbers, starting a production order, or quickly looking up information about items in a location.</li>
<li>Create work that will be performed through another process. For example, receiving an item for a purchase order can create put-away work for another worker.</li>
<li>Perform work that was created by another process (existing work), such as put-away work that was created when an item was received for a purchase order.</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a menu item for an activity or inquiry, set the <strong>Mode</strong> field to <strong>Indirect</strong>. A list of <strong>Activity code</strong> options then becomes available, so that you can select the type of inquiry or activity that the menu item is for. To create a menu item to generate warehouse work, set the <strong>Mode</strong> field to <strong>Work</strong>. A list of <strong>Work creation process</strong> options then becomes available. To create a menu item to process existing warehouse work, set the <strong>Mode</strong> field to <strong>Work</strong>, and then set the <strong>Use existing work</strong> option to <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Additional fields might be available for menu items, depending on the mode that you select for the menu item, and whether the menu item is used to perform existing work. For information about the additional field selections, see the “Additional menu item options” section later in this topic.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="configure-menu-items-for-activities-and-inquiries">Configure menu items for activities and inquiries</h2>
<p>If the <strong>Mode</strong> field for a menu item is set to <strong>Indirect</strong>, you can create a menu item to perform a general activity or inquiry that doesn't create work. Examples include reprinting license plate labels and an inquiry about the items in a location. The following table lists the options that are available.</p>
<table>
<thead>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reprint label</td>
<td>Reprint a license plate label.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>License plate build</td>
<td>Create a parent license plate by combining multiple license plates in the same location. This option is useful if you move multiple license plates at the same time. After the parent license plate is moved, you must perform a license plate break before you can pick items from each license plate. <p><strong>Tip:</strong> To move a parent license plate, you must use a mobile device that is configured to create work for movements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>License plate break</td>
<td>Break up a license plate build so that you can pick items from the license plates that were in the build.</td>

<tr>
<td>Driver check in</td>
<td>If you’re using Transportation management, register the arrival of a driver by scanning the outbound load ID, appointment ID, or shipment ID. For this option, a load must be assigned to the appointment, and the status of the load must be <strong>Loaded</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Driver check out</td>
<td>Register that a driver has completed his or her appointment.</td>

This list is intended to be viewed on tablet devices that have a screen size of 7 inches or more. When you select this option, the <strong>Edit query</strong> and <strong>Field list</strong> menu items become available. The <strong>Edit query</strong> page lets you set up criteria for the work that appears in the list. The <strong>Field list</strong> page lets you select what fields appear in the work list. For example, you can reduce the number of fields that appear, so that the user can more quickly select the most appropriate work item. On the <strong>General</strong> FastTab, in the <strong>Records per page</strong> field, you can also select how many work records are shown per page. If the <strong>Allow users to filter work by transaction type</strong> option is selected, the work list will include a <strong>Filter work</strong> control that the user can use to filter by transaction type. In the work list, users will see only work that they have permission to access. You must make sure that users have permission for one or more user-directed menu items that support the specific work class types that they should be able to access. Permissions are verified when a user tries to perform work from the list.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Create transfer order from license plates</td>
<td>Allows warehouse workers create and process transfer orders directly from the warehouse app. The warehouse workers start by selecting the destination warehouse and can then scan one or more license plates using the app. When the warehouse worker selects <strong>Complete order</strong>, a batch job will create the required transfer order and order lines based on the on-hand inventory registered for those license plates. For more information, see <a href="create-transfer-order-from-warehouse-app.html">Create transfer orders from the warehouse app</a></td>

<h2 id="configure-menu-items-to-create-work-for-another-worker-or-process">Configure menu items to create work for another worker or process</h2>
<p>You can set up a menu item that creates work for another worker after an initial action is performed on the mobile device. For example, when one worker uses a mobile device to receive an item, put-away work is created for another worker. To set up a menu item that creates work, on the <strong>Mobile device menu items</strong> page, in the <strong>Mode</strong> field, select <strong>Work</strong>. In the following table, the options in the <strong>Work creation process</strong> field are arranged by work order type.</p>

<h2 id="configure-menu-items-to-process-existing-work">Configure menu items to process existing work</h2>
<p>In addition to setting up menu items to create warehouse work, you can set up menu items to process work that has already been created. Set the <strong>Mode</strong> field to <strong>Work</strong>, and select the <strong>Use existing work</strong> option. Some additional options then become available on the <strong>General</strong> tab. You can control access to the menu item by assigning one or more work classes on the <strong>Work class</strong> FastTab. The work classes define the work that the menu item can process. The work class can also be used to grant access to specific user roles or to separate processing for different types of operations. The following table describes the options that are available. The option can be chosen under the <strong>Directed by</strong> field in the <strong>Mobile device menu items</strong> page.</p>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>System grouping</td>
<td>Supply Chain Management groups work for the worker, based on a specified field. For example, picking work is grouped when a worker scans a shipment ID, load ID, or any value that can link each work unit. If you select this option, the following fields are required:
<ul>
<li><strong>System grouping field</strong> – Select the field that the worker scans to group the work.</li>
<li><strong>System grouping label</strong> – Enter text to instruct the worker what to scan to group the work.</li>
</ul></td>

<ul>
<li><strong>Validated user directed field</strong> – Select the field that the worker scans to group the work.</li>
<li><strong>Validated user directed label</strong> – Enter text that instructs the worker what to scan when picking work is grouped by the system.</li>
</ul>
This option is useful when, for example, multiple pallets are staged for a load. If you select <strong>LoadId</strong> in the <strong>Validated User Directed</strong> field, the worker can pick any pallet that is associated with the load. The worker receives an error message if he or she scans an item that isn&#39;t associated with the load.</td>

<td>Select this option to let workers specify a location that overrides the suggested staging or loading location. All the remaining put-away work is directed to the new location. This option is useful when, for example, a worker who must put items for order 1 in a staging location by Dock 1 can’t, because a previous load hasn’t cleared the location. Instead of waiting for the Dock 1 staging location to become available, the worker can decide to use the staging location for Dock 2. In this case, the worker overrides the suggested staging location. The put location for all remaining items for the work order is then updated to the Dock 2 staging location.

<h2 id="require-workers-to-confirm-the-product-location-or-quantity-when-they-pick-items">Require workers to confirm the product, location, or quantity when they pick items</h2>
<p>You can set up work confirmations that require that a worker use a mobile device to register the location or quantity when they perform work in the warehouse. Work confirmations help ensure that the worker is at the correct location or is handling the correct quantity of items. You can also enable Supply Chain Management to automatically confirm the worker’s registration. If you enable automatic confirmation, you can't also require confirmations for location or quantity. Work confirmations also include products and product variants. Additionally, you can register confirmations by scanning a bar code. To confirm products and product variants, you must enter an ID for the product or product variant. This ID can be a product ID, product search ID, external ID, GTIN, or bar code. After you enter the ID or scan the bar code, the dimensions for the product variant are displayed on the mobile device.</p>
<p>The following table describes the various work types that you can use work confirmations with.</p>
