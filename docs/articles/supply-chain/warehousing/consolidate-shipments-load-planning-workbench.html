<p>This topic presents a scenario where multiple orders are released to the warehouse in the same load and are then automatically consolidated into shipments.</p>
<h2 id="make-demo-data-available">Make demo data available</h2>
<p>The scenario in this topic references values and records that are included in the standard demo data that is provided for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. If you want to use the values that are provided here as you do the exercises, be sure to work in an environment where the demo data is installed, and set the legal entity to <strong>USMF</strong> before you begin.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-shipment-consolidation-policies-and-product-filters">Set up shipment consolidation policies and product filters</h2>
<p>The scenario that is described here assumes that you've already turned on the feature, done the exercises in <a href="configure-shipment-consolidation-policies.html">Configure shipment consolidation policies</a>, and created the policies and other records that are described there. Be sure to do those exercises before you continue with this scenario.</p>
<h2 id="create-the-sales-orders-for-this-scenario">Create the sales orders for this scenario</h2>
<p>Start by creating a collection of sales orders that you can work with. You must work with a warehouse that is enabled for advanced warehouse (WMS) processes. Unless a different warehouse is explicitly mentioned, that same warehouse must be used for each of the following sets of orders.</p>
<p>Go to <strong>Accounts receivable &gt; Orders &gt; All sales orders</strong>, and create a collection of sales orders that have the settings that are described in the following subsections.</p>

<h2 id="verify-the-shipments">Verify the shipments</h2>
<p>The following procedure lets you verify the shipments that have been created or updated as a result of shipment consolidation.

<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Warehouse management &gt; Shipments &gt; All shipments</strong>.</li>
<li>Find and select the required shipment.</li>
<li>If a consolidation policy was used when the shipment was created or updated, you should see it in the <strong>Shipment consolidation policy</strong> field.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="release-order-set-1-in-one-load">Release order set 1 in one load</h3>
<p>Two shipments should have been created:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first shipment contains three lines and was created by using the <em>CustomerMode</em> shipment consolidation policy.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="release-order-set-3-in-one-load">Release order set 3 in one load</h3>
<p>Two shipments should have been created:</p>

<li>The second shipment contains order lines from sales order where the <strong>Customer requisition</strong> field is set to <em>2</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="release-order-set-4-in-one-load">Release order set 4 in one load</h3>
<p>Four shipments should have been created:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines from two orders for customer account <em>US-003</em> were grouped into one shipment by using the <em>Order pool</em> shipment consolidation policy.</li>
<li>Lines from two orders for customer account <em>US-004</em> were grouped into one shipment by using the <em>Order pool</em> shipment consolidation policy.</li>
<li>Lines from sales orders 4-5 and 4-6 for customer account <em>US-007</em> were grouped into one shipment by using the <em>Order pool</em> shipment consolidation policy.</li>
<li>Lines from sales orders 4-7 and 4-8 for customer account <em>US-007</em> were grouped into one shipment by using the <em>CrossOrder</em> shipment consolidation policy.</li>
