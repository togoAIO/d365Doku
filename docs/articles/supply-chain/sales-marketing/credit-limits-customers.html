<p>Setting a credit limit lets you specify the maximum amount of credit to extend
to your customers. If a credit limit is specified, it is checked automatically
when a user attempts to update a document. If the credit limit is exceeded, a
message is displayed to the user. This article provides an overview of how credit
limits work  and answers the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What documents and processes can I check credit limits for?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Where do I configure the way that the customer’s remaining credit is
calculated?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Where is information about a customer’s remaining credit used?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Where do I specify whether identification is required for credit to be
extended to a customer, and also the credit limit amount that requires
identification?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Where do I specify whether to display a warning or error if the credit limit
is exceeded?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How do I specify the credit limit for a specific customer?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How do I check credit limits manually on sales orders?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What documents and processes can I check credit limits for?</strong></p>
<p>Use the <strong>Accounts receivable parameters</strong> form to specify which documents to
check credit limits for. You must be a member of the System administrator
(-SYSADMIN-) security role to make changes in this form. You can check credit
limits for the following documents and processes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Invoices for sales orders, when you post the invoices</p>
</li>
<li><p>Packing slips for sales orders, when you update packing slips</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sales orders, when you add lines in the <strong>Sales order</strong> form</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sales orders, when they are created through a service</p>
</li>
<li><p>Free text invoices, when you post the invoices</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Credit limits are automatically checked if either of the following options is
set:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the <strong>Accounts receivable parameters</strong> form, the <strong>Credit limit type</strong>
field is set to anything other than <strong>None</strong>. Credit limits are checked for
all customers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Accounts receivable parameters</strong> form, the <strong>Credit limit type</strong>
field is set to <strong>None</strong> but <strong>Mandatory credit limit</strong> is selected for a
customer in the <strong>Customers</strong> form. Credit limits are checked only for
specific customers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To check credit limits for the following documents, you must specify additional
settings.</p>

<p><strong>Where do I configure the way that a customer’s remaining credit is
calculated?</strong></p>
<p>You can configure Dynamics 365 to calculate a customer’s remaining
credit in any of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Compare the credit limit against the customer balance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Compare the credit limit against the customer balance and packing slip
amounts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Compare the credit limit against the customer balance and all open
transaction activity. This includes packing slip amounts and sales order
amounts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the <strong>Accounts receivable parameters</strong> form to specify the information to
compare to. You must be a member of the System administrator (-SYSADMIN-)
security role to make changes in this form. In the <strong>Credit limit type</strong> field,
select whether to perform credit limit checks and what transaction information
to include when the credit limit is checked. Select from the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>None</strong> – Do not check credit limits. You can override this option for a
specific customer by selecting the <strong>Mandatory credit limit</strong> check box in
the <strong>Customers</strong> form. If you do this, the credit limit is checked against
the customer balance.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Balance</strong> – The credit limit is checked against the customer balance.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Balance + packing slip or product receipt</strong> – The credit limit is checked
against the customer balance and deliveries.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Balance+All</strong> – The credit limit is checked against the customer balance,
deliveries, and open orders.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where is information about a customer’s remaining credit used?</strong></p>
<p>Information about a customer’s balance and remaining credit amount is calculated
and stored when you create an aging snapshot, and is displayed in the
<strong>Collections</strong> form. The amounts that are displayed in the <strong>Collections</strong> form
might not include all transaction activity until a new aging snapshot is
created. For more information, see <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh209221.aspx">Collections and credit in Accounts
receivable</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on the documents that are selected, information about a customer’s
balance and remaining credit amount is calculated when sales orders, packing
slips, and customer invoices are updated. If the amount of the document that you
are working with would cause the credit limit to be exceeded, a message is
displayed.</p>
<p><strong>Where do I specify whether identification is required for credit to be
extended to a customer, and also the credit limit that requires
identification?</strong></p>
<p>Use the <strong>Accounts receivable parameters</strong> form to specify whether to require
identification and the credit limit amount limit that requires identification.
You must be a member of the System administrator (-SYSADMIN-) security role to
make changes in this form.</p>

this form.</p>
