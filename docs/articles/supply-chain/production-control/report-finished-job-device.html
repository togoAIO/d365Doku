<h1 id="report-as-finished-from-the-job-card-device">Report as finished from the job card device</h1>


<p>Workers use the <strong>Report progress</strong> page on the job card device to report quantities that have been completed for a production job. This topic describes how to set up various options that establish how workers can report as finished using this page and what happens next. Options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control whether and how quantities that are reported as finished are added to inventory.</li>
<li>Control whether and how batch numbers are generated and applied when reporting as finished.</li>
<li>Control whether and how serial numbers are generated and applied when reporting as finished.</li>
<li>Control whether and how to report as finished to a license plate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="control-whether-quantities-that-are-reported-as-finished-are-added-to-inventory">Control whether quantities that are reported as finished are added to inventory</h2>
<p>To control whether and how the quantities that are reported as finished on the last operation should be added to inventory, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Product control &gt; Setup &gt; Manufacturing execution &gt; Production order defaults</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Report as finished</strong> tab, set the <strong>Update finished report on-line</strong> field to one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No</strong> – No quantity will be added to inventory when quantities are reported on the last operation. The status of the production order will never change.</li>
<li><strong>Status + Quantity</strong> – The status of the production order will change to <em>Reported as finished</em>, and the quantity will be reported as finished to inventory.</li>
<li><strong>Quantity</strong> – The quantity will be reported as finished to inventory, but the status of the production order will never change.</li>
<li><strong>Status</strong> – Only the status of the production order will change. No quantities will be added to inventory when quantities are reported on the last operation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Quantities aren't tracked in inventory if the operations that they are reported as finished on aren't defined as the last operation. However, those quantities can be used to view progress. They can also be included in rules that control whether workers can start the next operation before a defined threshold of reported quantities on the previous operation is reached. You can define these rules on the <strong>Quantity validation</strong> tab on the <strong>Production order defaults</strong> page.</p>
</div>
<p>For more information about how to work with the <strong>Production order defaults</strong> page, see <a href="production-parameters-manufacturing-execution.html">Production parameters in Manufacturing execution</a>.</p>
<h2 id="report-batch-controlled-items-as-finished">Report batch-controlled items as finished</h2>
<p>The job card device supports three scenarios for reporting on batch items. These scenarios apply both to items that are enabled for advanced warehouse processes and to items that aren't enabled for advanced warehouse processes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manually assigned batch numbers</strong> - Workers enter a custom batch number. This batch number might come from an external source that isn't known to the system.</li>
<li><strong>Predefined batch numbers</strong> - Workers select a batch number in a list of batch numbers that the system automatically generates before the production order is released to the job card device.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed batch numbers</strong> - Workers don't enter or select a batch number. Instead, the system automatically assigns a batch number to the production order before it's released.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="enable-the-feature-on-your-system">Enable the feature on your system</h3>
<p>To enable your job card devices to accept a batch number during reporting as finished, you must use <a href="../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.html">feature management</a> to turn on the following features (in this order):</p>
<ol>
<li>Improved user experience for the Report progress dialog in the Job Card Device</li>
<li>Enable to enter batch and serial numbers while reporting as finished from the Job Card Device (Preview)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="configure-products-that-require-batch-number-reporting">Configure products that require batch number reporting</h3>
<p>To enable a product to support any of the available batch-controlled scenarios, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Product information management &gt; Products &gt; Released products</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the product to configure.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Manage inventory</strong> FastTab, in the <strong>Batch number group</strong> field, select the tracking number group that is set up to support your scenario.</li>
</ol>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>By default, if no batch number group is assigned to a batch-controlled product, the job card device provides manual entry for the batch number during reporting as finished.</p>
</div>
<p>The following sections describe how to set up tracking number groups to support each of the three scenarios for reporting on batch items.</p>
<h3 id="set-up-a-tracking-number-group-that-lets-workers-manually-assign-a-batch-number">Set up a tracking number group that lets workers manually assign a batch number</h3>
<p>To allow for manually assigned batch numbers, follow these steps to set up a tracking number group.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Inventory management &gt; Setup &gt; Dimensions &gt; Tracking number groups</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create or select the tracking number group to set up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>General</strong> FastTab, set the <strong>Manual</strong> option to <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="media/tracking-number-group-manual.png" alt="A tracking number group for manual batch numbers" title="A tracking number group for manual batch numbers"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Set other values as you require, and then select this tracking number group as the batch number group for released products that you want to use this scenario for.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When you use this scenario, the <strong>Batch number</strong> field that the <strong>Report progress</strong> page on the job card device provides is a text box where workers can enter any value.</p>

<h3 id="set-up-a-tracking-number-group-that-provides-a-list-of-predefined-batch-numbers">Set up a tracking number group that provides a list of predefined batch numbers</h3>
<p>To provide a list of predefined batch numbers, follow these steps to set up a tracking number group.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Inventory management &gt; Setup &gt; Dimensions &gt; Tracking number groups</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create or select the tracking number group to set up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>General</strong> FastTab, set the <strong>Only for inventory transactions</strong> option to <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use the <strong>Per qty</strong> field to split batch numbers per quantity, based on the value that you enter. For example, you have a production order for ten pieces, and the <strong>Per qty</strong> field is set to <em>2</em>. In this case, five batch numbers will be assigned to the production order when it's created.</p>
<p><img src="media/tracking-number-group-predefined.png" alt="A tracking number group for predefined batch numbers" title="A tracking number group for predefined batch numbers"></p>

<h2 id="report-serial-controlled-items-as-finished">Report serial-controlled items as finished</h2>
<p>The job card device supports three scenarios for reporting on serial-controlled items. These scenarios apply both to items that are enabled for advanced warehouse processes and to items that aren't enabled for advanced warehouse processes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manually assigned serial numbers</strong> - Workers enter a custom serial number. This serial number might come from an external source that isn't known to the system.</li>
<li><strong>Predefined serial numbers</strong> - Workers select a serial number in a list of serial numbers that the system automatically generates before the production order is released to the job card device.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed serial number</strong> - Workers don't enter or select a serial number. Instead, the system automatically assigns a serial number to the production order before it's released.</li>
