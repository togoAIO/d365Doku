<p>Some or all of the functionality noted in this topic is available as part of a preview release. The content and the functionality are subject to change. For more information about preview releases, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/fin-and-ops/get-started/public-preview-releases">Service update availability</a>.</p>

<p>Finance insights provides configurable and extensible models to help you accurately and intelligently predict your company's cash flow, predict when you will receive payment for outstanding receivables, and generate a budget proposal that can speed up your budgeting process. All these features are based on intelligent machine learning models. When these new capabilities are combined with automation in vendor payments and collections, they provide a rich and intelligent financial system that drives decision making and helps you take action to respond effectively to current and anticipated business challenges.</p>
<p>Finance insights preview is available for trial deployments in the United States of America, Europe, and the United Kingdom. Microsoft is incrementally adding support for more regions.</p>
<p>Preview features can and should be turned on only in Tier-2 sandbox environments. Setup and artificial intelligence (AI) models that are created in a sandbox environment can't be migrated to a production environment. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/legal/supp-dynamics365-preview#:%7E:text=Supplemental%20Terms%20of%20Use%20for%20Microsoft%20Dynamics%20365,%28governing%20your%20use%20of%20Microsoft%20Dynamics%20365%20Online%29.">Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Previews</a>.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>This section lists the requirements for using Finance insights. Wherever possible, links to sources of additional information are provided.</p>
<h3 id="legal-requirements">Legal requirements</h3>
<p>To apply for the preview program, fill out the <a href="https://forms.office.com/FormsPro/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR56j8lZs0FdAvwT75_WNFyxUM1c0Uzc1RFpaU1RVTEwxVTNWUERPRThUSy4u">Finance insights Preview for Dynamics 365 Finance agreement</a>.</p>
<h3 id="system-requirements">System requirements</h3>
<p>A Tier-2 sandbox environment (multi-box) is required to preview Finance insights. For background information about environments, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/imp-lifecycle/environment-planning">Environment planning</a>.</p>
<h3 id="version-requirements">Version requirements</h3>
<p>This document applies to version 10.0.11 of Finance and Operations apps (Platform update 35), and later versions.</p>
<h3 id="historical-data-requirements">Historical data requirements</h3>
<p>At least one year's worth of customer invoices is required to correctly train the machine learning model that is used for the Customer payment predictions feature.</p>
<p>Sample data is available for demo systems that have the Contoso demo data set.</p>
<h3 id="role-and-permission-requirements">Role and permission requirements</h3>
<p>Changes will be made to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance, Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), Power Apps, and Azure. Correct permissions are required across these environments. Here are some examples of the changes that will be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new environment will be created in Microsoft Power Platform.</li>
<li>A storage account, key vault, and application will be created in Azure.</li>
<li>The Active Directory tenant administrator will have to authorize the AI Builder application to access the data lake.</li>
<li>The feature will be turned on in Dynamics 365.</li>
</ul>
<p>Familiarity with the process of creating and managing resources in Azure, Microsoft Dataverse, and LCS will be helpful as you complete this process.</p>
<h2 id="configure-finance-insights">Configure Finance insights</h2>
<p>You must complete some configuration steps before you can use Finance insights. For more information about how to configure Finance insights, see <a href="configure-for-fin-insites.html">Configuration for Finance insights</a>.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-data-integrator-project">Create a data integrator project</h2>
<p>You'll need to create a data integrator project so that data that the machine learning model generates can flow into Dynamics 365 Finance. For the steps to create that project, see <a href="create-data-integrate-project.html">Create a data integrator project</a>.</p>
<h2 id="enable-finance-insights-capabilities">Enable Finance insights capabilities</h2>
<p>When you've completed the configuration steps and set up demo data, you must turn on and set up each capability that you plan to use: customer payment predictions, cash flow forecasting, and budget proposals.</p>
<h3 id="enable-customer-payment-predictions">Enable Customer payment predictions</h3>
<p>If you are using demo data to test customer payment predictions, you may have to import additional demo data to create your AI model successfully. For the specific steps to import demo data, see <a href="set-up-demo-data.md">Set up demo data for payment predictions</a>.</p>
<p>To enable Customer payment predictions, you must complete a set of steps to build a machine learning model that uses your organization's data your organization's data to generate predictions about when customers are likely to pay outstanding invoices, and when specific invoices are likely to be paid. For more information and the specific steps to complete, see <a href="enable-cust-paymnt-prediction.html">Enable customer payment predictions</a>.</p>
<h3 id="enable-cash-flow-forecasting">Enable Cash flow forecasting</h3>
<p>To enable Cash flow forecasting, you must complete a set of steps to build a machine learning model that uses your organization's data your organization's data to to generate cash flow forecasts. For more information and the specific steps to complete, see <a href="enable-cash-flow-forecasting.html">Enable cash flow forecasting</a></p>
<h3 id="set-up-and-use-cash-flow-forecasting">Set up and use cash flow forecasting</h3>
<p>For information about how to set up and use cash flow forecasting, see <a href="enable-cash-flow-forecasting.html">Enable cash flow forecasting</a>. For more information about how to use this capability, see <a href="cash-flow-forecast-intro.html">Cash flow forecasting</a>.</p>
<h3 id="enable-budget-proposals">Enable budget proposals</h3>
<p>The Budget proposals feature uses a machine learning model along with your organization's historical data to generate a budget proposal. The generated proposal can help you begin a budgeting process that is more effective and efficient than a manual process. For the specific steps to enable this feature, see  <a href="enable-budget-proposal.html">Enable budget proposals</a>.</p>
<h2 id="using-finance-insights-features">Using Finance insights features</h2>
<h3 id="using-customer-payment-predictions">Using Customer payment predictions</h3>
<p>The intelligent cash flow forecasting is built on top of existing the cash flow forecasting functionality in Dynamics 365 Finance. To review the existing capability, see <a href="../cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.html">Cash flow forecasting</a>.</p>
