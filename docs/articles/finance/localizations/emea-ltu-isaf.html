<p>Starting from version <strong>52.4</strong> of the <strong>i.SAF format (LT)</strong> ER configuration, the format includes application-specific parameters where a user must define which <strong>Sales tax codes</strong> in the system correspond to which values from the enumerated list of VAT codes prescript as &quot;Standard VAT codes&quot;.</p>
<ol>
<li>To setup application-specific parameters, go to the <strong>Electronic Reporting</strong> workspace, select the <strong>i.SAF format (LT)</strong> format, and then select <strong>Configurations</strong> &gt; <strong>Application specific parameters</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>.</li>
<li>On the Action Pane, on the <strong>Lookups</strong> tab, select <strong>ReportTaxCodesLookup</strong> to view the latest version of the format.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Conditions</strong> FastTab, define which <strong>Standard VAT codes</strong> must correspond to which <strong>System Sales tax codes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if you have in the system two <strong>System Sales tax codes</strong>, VAT1 and VAT2 which must be reported in one <strong>Standard VAT codes PVM1</strong>, you would need to add the following lines on the <strong>Conditions</strong> FastTab:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Lookup result</th>
<th>Line</th>
<th>Tax Code</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>PVM1</strong> (the value must be selected from the predefined enumerated list)</td>
<td>1</td>
<td><strong>VAT1</strong> (the value must be selected from the list of values which are entries in the <strong>Sales tax codes</strong> table)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>PVM1</strong> (the value must be selected from the predefined enumerated list)</td>
<td>2</td>
<td><strong>VAT2</strong> (the value must be selected from the list of values which are entries in the <strong>Sales tax codes</strong> table)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <strong>Line</strong> column is used for the counter which controls the order of execution of the conditions of the lookup field.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Add all of the conditions for those “Standard VAT codes” that must be reported for your Legal entity. According to documentation, the list of “Standard VAT codes” is the following:</li>
</ol>
<table>

<th><strong>Line</strong></th>
<th><strong>Tax Code</strong></th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>PVM100</strong></td>
<td>The last in your list</td>
<td><strong>*Not blank*</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>It is important to add “PVM100” which must collect data by “other cases” as the last in the list. The <strong>Line</strong> value must be the last in your table.</p>
</div>
<p>This setup means that all the tax transactions for <strong>Sales tax code</strong>, of which there is no specific setup as no “Standard VAT code” is specifically defined for it, will be considered for <strong>PVM100.</strong> It is mandatory to define this lookup result field at the end of the list of your conditions.</p>
<p>You can easily export the setup of application-specific parameters from one version of a report and import it into another version. You can also export the setup from one report and import it into another report, provided that both reports have the same structure of lookup fields.</p>
<p>When you've finished setting up conditions, change the value of the <strong>State</strong> field to <strong>Completed</strong>, save your changes, and close the page.</p>

<p><strong>Electronic Messages</strong> functionality is provided to maintain different processes of electronic reporting of different document types. For more information about Electronic messages, see <a href="../general-ledger/electronic-messaging.html">Electronic messaging</a>.</p>
<p>The process of setting up the Electronic messages functionality for i.SAF has many steps. Because the names of some predefined entities are used in the ER configurations, it's important that you use a set of predefined values that are delivered in a package of data entities for the related tables.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Before you import setup data from the package of data entities, complete the  to make sure that the data entities in your application are refreshed and synced.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>In <a href="https://lcs.dynamics.com/v2">LCS</a>, go to the Shared asset library, and select the <strong>Data package</strong> asset type.</li>
<li>Find <strong>LT i.SAF setup for Electronic messages.zip</strong> in the list of data package files, and download it to your computer.</li>
<li>After the <strong>LT i.SAF setup for Electronic messages.zip</strong> file is downloaded, open Finance, select the company that you will interoperate with HMRC from, and then go to <strong>Workspaces</strong> &gt; <strong>Data management</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Data management</strong> workspace, go to <strong>Framework parameters</strong> &gt; <strong>Entity settings</strong>, and then select <strong>Refresh entity list</strong>. Wait for confirmation that the refresh has been completed. For more information about how to refresh the entity list, see <a href="../../dev-itpro/data-entities/data-entities.md#entity-list-refresh">Entity list refresh</a>.</li>
<li>Validate that the source data and target data are correctly mapped. For more information, see the section about validation in <a href="../../dev-itpro/data-entities/data-import-export-job.md#validate-that-the-source-data-and-target-data-are-mapped-correctly">Data import and export jobs</a>.</li>
<li>Before the data entities are used for the first time to import the data from the package, sync the mapping of source data and target data. In the list for the package, select a data entity, and then, on the Action Pane, select <strong>Modify target mapping</strong>.</li>
<li>Above the grid for the package, select <strong>Generate mapping</strong> to create a mapping from scratch and then save the mapping.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 6 and 7 for each data entity in the package before you start the import.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information about data management, see <a href="../../dev-itpro/data-entities/data-entities-data-packages.md">Data management</a>.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>You must now import data from the <strong>LT i.SAF setup for Electronic messages.zip</strong> file into the selected company. In the <strong>Data management</strong> workspace, select <strong>Import</strong>, and set the <strong>Source data format</strong> field to <strong>Package</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Upload and add</strong>, select the <strong>LT i.SAF setup for Electronic messages.zip</strong> file on your computer, and upload it.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="media/isaf-data-management.jpg" alt="Import a package of data entities"></p>
<p>You will get a notification in <strong>Messages</strong>, or you can manually refresh the page to see data import progress. When the importing process is complete, you will see the results on <strong>Execution summary</strong> page.</p>
<p>The <strong>LT i.SAF setup for Electronic messages.zip</strong> package provides a setup for <strong>&quot;i.SAF&quot;</strong> processing that supports the process of i.SAF reporting composed generaly of three elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Populate invoices</strong> – Invoices are added to the <strong>Message items</strong> table.</li>
<li><strong>Attributes evaluation</strong> – The <strong>Document type</strong> field values are evaluated for all of the invoices added to the <strong>Message items</strong> table.</li>
<li><strong>Generate message</strong> – <strong>Electronic message</strong> will be created, and related <strong>Message items</strong> according to their status and criteria setup will be linked to the generated <strong>Electronic message</strong>. The i.SAF report will be generated and attached to the <strong>Electronic message</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="set-up-data-sources-to-collect-documents-to-be-reported">Set up data sources to collect documents to be reported</h2>
<p><strong>i.SAF</strong> processing lets you collect invoices to be reported in the legal entity. You can then generate an i.SAF report. The collection of invoices is implemented by using the <strong>Populate invoices</strong> action of the <strong>Populate record</strong> type. To correctly collect invoices, you must define a period for the <strong>Populate invoices</strong> action.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Electronic messages</strong> &gt; <strong>Populate records actions</strong>, and select <strong>Populate invoices</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For <strong>i.SAF</strong> processing, default data sources set up includes following three data sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VendInvoiceJour:</strong> Go to <strong>Accounts payable</strong> &gt; <strong>Inquiries and reports</strong> &gt; <strong>Invoice</strong> &gt; <strong>Invoice journal</strong></li>
<li><strong>CustInvoiceJour:</strong> Go to <strong>Accounts receivable</strong> &gt; <strong>Inquiries and reports</strong> &gt; <strong>Invoice</strong> &gt; <strong>Invoice journal</strong></li>
<li><strong>ProjInvoiceJour:</strong> Go to <strong>Project management and accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Project invoices</strong> &gt; <strong>Project invoices</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>By default, all records from these data sources will be populated to the <strong>Message items</strong> table when you select <strong>Populate records</strong>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>On the <strong>Datasource setup</strong> FastTab, select the <strong>Vendor invoice journal</strong> record, and then select <strong>Edit query</strong>.</li>
<li>For the <strong>Date</strong> field of the <strong>Vendor invoice journal</strong> table, define the period from which vendor invoices from the selected legal entity must be reported in i.SAF format. You can specify other selection criteria here to reflect specific requirements of your company to i.SAF report.</li>
<li>Repeat the same setup for other data sources of the report (Sales invoice journal, Project invoice journal) or delete unnecessary data sources from the list.</li>
