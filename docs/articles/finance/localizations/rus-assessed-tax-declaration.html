<h1 id="assessed-tax-declaration-russia">Assessed tax declaration (Russia)</h1>


<p>According to the tax code of the Russian Federation, realty assets are subject to assessed tax.</p>
<p>The tax period for assessed tax is one year. The advance payments must be calculated and paid to tax authorities for the first quarter, the second quarter (six months or half year), and the third quarter (nine months).</p>
<p>At the end of the tax period, a company must report an assessed tax declaration that also includes information about the amounts of quarterly advance payments. Before the year 2019, at the end of each quarter, the company had to report an assessed tax advance payments calculation declaration. Starting from the year 2019, the assessed tax advance payments calculation declaration is canceled.</p>
<p>The assessed tax declaration should be submitted to one of the following tax authorities:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tax authority where the realty is located. In this case, the code <strong>281</strong> should be entered for the <strong>at place of</strong> attribute.</li>
<li>The tax authority where the company is registered. In this case, the code <strong>214</strong> should be entered for the <strong>at place of</strong> attribute.</li>
<li>If the organization is a greatest taxpayer, the tax authority where the organization is registered as a greatest taxpayer. In this case, the code <strong>213</strong> should be entered for the <strong>at place of</strong> attribute.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tax base for the calculation of assessed tax is either the annual average cost of the realty asset or the cadastral cost of the realty asset.</p>
<p>The annual average cost is calculated as the sum of residual values (net book values) for the realty fixed asset on the first day of each month of the tax (or reporting) period, and on the first day of the month after the tax (or reporting) period. This sum is then divided by the number of months in the tax period plus one. Realty assets that are taxed at the annual average cost are reported in section 2 of the assessed tax declaration.</p>
<p>The cadastral cost is defined by cadastral authorities and should be specified by the user on the fixed asset card. Realty assets that are taxed at the cadastral cost are reported in section 3 of the assessed tax declaration.</p>

<p>By default, realty objects are considered to be located at the organization's location and reported to the tax authority in the legal entity's territory. (The OKTMO code of the tax authority matches the OKTMO code of the legal entity, and realty objects are reported under the same OKTMO code.)</p>
<p>If the organization has realty objects that are located in different territories and registered in different tax authorities, you must specify the location of the realty asset.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Fixed assets (Russia) &gt; Common &gt; Fixed assets</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the line for the realty asset.</li>
<li>On the Action Pane, on the <strong>Fixed asset</strong> tab, in the <strong>History</strong> group, select <strong>Transfer</strong>.</li>

</ol>
<h4 id="change-the-cadastral-cost-of-realty-that-is-taxed-according-to-cadastral-rules">Change the cadastral cost of realty that is taxed according to cadastral rules</h4>
<p>The cadastral cost of a realty asset might change because of a change in qualitative and quantitative characteristics. Follow these steps to record the change in cadastral value.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Fixed assets (Russia) &gt; Common &gt; Fixed assets</strong>.</li>

<h2 id="calculate-assessed-tax-registers">Calculate assessed tax registers</h2>
<p>After you've finished the setup, registered the acquisition of realty assets, and set up all realty asset parameters for assessed tax calculation, you must calculate assessed tax registers. The following tax registers are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cost calculation</strong> – Depending on the method of tax base calculation, this tax register calculates either the net book values of each realty asset as of the first day of each month in the reporting period or the cadastral cost of each asset during that period. These amounts will be used as the basis for the tax base calculation for the tax amount that must be paid in the territory that is identified by the OKTMO code. The register also shows the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The owned share, if the realty is partially owned</li>
<li>The distributed property share, if the realty is distributed (asset kind 02)</li>
<li>The ownership period and factor, if the realty was acquired or sold during the period</li>
<li>The cost change period and factor, if the cadastral cost changed during the period</li>
<li>The assessed tax rate, budget revenue code, asset kind code, separate division ID, and location of the realty, the tax authority that the tax for the realty will be reported to, the acquisition date of the realty, and the code for tax allowance through exemption from tax or tax base reduction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Totals of net book value calculation</strong> – This tax register is a technical register that is calculated based on the data in the <strong>Cost calculation</strong> tax register. Depending on the method of tax base calculation, it shows either the tax-exempt net book values as of the first day of each month in the reporting period or the tax-exempt cadastral cost of the asset.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Assessed tax</strong> – This tax register is the basis for an assessed tax declaration. It's calculated based on the data in the <strong>Totals of net book value calculation</strong> tax register. For each OKTMO code, budget revenue code, and realty asset, this register shows the following data that must be reported in the declaration:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average cost and average cost of exempt realty, or the cadastral value and cadastral value of exempt realty, depending on the method of tax base calculation for the realty, and the code for tax allowance through exemption from tax or tax base reduction</li>
<li>The owned share, if the realty is partially owned</li>
<li>The distributed property share, if the realty is distributed</li>
<li>The ownership period and factor, if the realty was acquired or sold during the period</li>
<li>The cost change period and factor, if the cadastral cost changed during the period</li>
<li>The tax rate and the code for tax allowance through reduction of the tax rate</li>
<li>The tax base, tax amount (or advance payment amount), advance amount for previous periods, and code and amount for tax allowance through reduction of the tax amount</li>
<li>The tax amount that is paid outside Russia (This value isn't automatically calculated. If it's required, it must be manually entered.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To calculate and approve assessed tax registers, follow these steps.</p>
