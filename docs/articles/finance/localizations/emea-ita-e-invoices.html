<h1 id="customer-electronic-invoices">Customer electronic invoices</h1>


<p>This topic describes how to set up and work with the functionality for creating and sending sales invoices and project invoices in an electronic format (FatturaPA).</p>
<p>Version 1.2 of FatturaPA electronic invoices can be used for all types of businesses. These businesses include public administrations, private companies, and professionals.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The primary address of the legal entity must be in Italy.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>Before you can begin to work with the electronic invoice functionality, the following data must be set up:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#arparameters">Accounts receivable parameters</a></li>
<li><a href="#einvoicesparameters">Electronic invoice parameters</a></li>
<li><a href="#edproperties">Electronic document properties</a></li>

<li><a href="#destination">Optional: Destination for XML file output</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="arparameters">Accounts receivable parameters</h3>
<p>Select the configurations that are used to create electronic invoice XML files for sales and free text invoices, sales and free text credit notes, project invoices, and project credit notes. You can find these configurations on the <strong>Electronic document</strong> tab of the <strong>Accounts receivable parameters</strong> page (<strong>Accounts receivable</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts receivable parameters</strong>).</p>
<p><img src="media/emea-ita-electronic-invocies-AR-parameter-e-invoices.png" alt="Electronic document tab of the Accounts receivable parameters page"></p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The configurations must be imported before they can be selected. For more information, see <a href="../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-download-configurations-global-repo.html">Download ER configurations from the Global repository of Configuration service</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The functionality for electronic document properties is used to set up the output to XML document blocks for different business cases. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A value-added tax (VAT) registration number for customers who aren't in the European Union (EU) and don't have VAT registration codes</li>
<li>A certified email address (posta elettronica certificata [PEC]) for private companies or professionals</li>
<li>A stamp duty (payable and not payable by the customer)</li>
<li>Data about a customer's representative</li>
</ul>
<p>For the functionality to work, the following data must be set up:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Electronic document property types (<strong>Accounts receivable</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Electronic document property types</strong>) and the table that each document property type is applicable to. For electronic invoice functionality, the <strong>Customers</strong> and <strong>Legal entities</strong> tables are used.</p>
<p><img src="media/emea-ita-electronic-invocies-electronic-document-property-types.png" alt="Setting applicability on the Electronic document property types page"></p>

<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The preceding table uses the following shorthand:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Customer electronic document properties&quot; refers to the <strong>Electronic document properties</strong> page that is opened by selecting <strong>Electronic document properties</strong> on the <strong>Customer</strong> tab on the Action Pane of the <strong>All customers</strong> page (<strong>Accounts receivable &gt; Customers &gt; All customers</strong>).</li>
<li>&quot;Legal entity electronic document properties&quot; refers the <strong>Electronic document properties</strong> page that is opened by selecting <strong>Electronic document properties</strong> on the Action Pane of the <strong>Legal entities</strong> page (<strong>Organization administration &gt; Organizations &gt; Legal entities</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>On the <strong>Electronic document property types</strong> list page, the <strong>Description</strong> field is automatically filled in when a user enters information in the <strong>Group description</strong> and <strong>Description</strong> fields.</p>
<p>The electronic document property type must have the same code that is specified in the table.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="use-project-categories-for-stamp-duty">Use project categories for stamp duty</h4>
<p>Go to <strong>Project management and accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Categories</strong> &gt; <strong>Project categories</strong> to set up project categories that have a transaction type of <strong>Fee</strong> or <strong>Expense</strong>. The category ID should equal the value that is defined for the <strong>Bollo</strong> document property type at the legal entity level. For more information, see the previous table.</p>
<p>The project category of the <strong>Fee</strong> transaction type can be used only for stamp duty that is included in the invoice. The project category of the <strong>Expense</strong> transaction type can be used for both stamp duty that is included in a customer invoice and stamp duty that isn't included. In both cases, the <strong>Bollo</strong> document property type is used.</p>
<p>When you create <strong>Fee</strong> or <strong>Expense</strong> journal lines, select the category that was defined for stamp duty, and enter a cost price. The system considers this cost price the stamp duty amount. If you enter a sales price that equals the cost price amount, the system considers this amount included in invoice totals. The sales price amount equals 0 (zero), and the transaction isn't included in invoice totals.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>You can use only one of the journal types (<strong>Fee</strong> or <strong>Expense</strong>) for stamp duty. A company that uses only payable stamp duty can use the <strong>Fee</strong> journal type. If a company uses both payable and non-payable stamp duty, it's better to use the <strong>Expense</strong> journal type.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="customers">Customers</h3>
<h4 id="authority-office-field">Authority office field</h4>
<p>You can find the <strong>Authority office</strong> field on the <strong>Sales demographics</strong> FastTab of a customer record (go to <strong>Accounts receivable</strong> &gt; <strong>Customers</strong> &gt; <strong>All customers</strong>, and open the customer record in <strong>Edit</strong> mode).</p>
<p>The value of this field is used to define the type of communication (business to government [B2G] or business to business [B2B]):</p>
<ul>
<li>If the length of the value is 6, the customer is considered a public administration (the transmission format equals <strong>FPA12</strong>).</li>
<li>If the length of the value is 7, the customer is considered a private company or professional (the transmission format equals <strong>FPR12</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, the system enters the value of this field in the <strong>CodiceDestinatario</strong> tag in the XML file.</p>
<p><img src="media/emea-ita-electronic-invocies-customer-authority-office.png" alt="Authority office field on the Sales demographics FastTab of a customer record"></p>
<p>If the <strong>Authority office</strong> field is blank, the system considers the customer a private company or professional (the transmission format equals <strong>FPR12</strong>), and enters <strong>0000000</strong> in the <strong>CodiceDestinatario</strong> tag in the XML file. In this case, a certified email address (PEC) should be set up. For more information, see the table in the <a href="#edproperties">Electronic documents properties</a> section earlier in this topic.</p>
<h4 id="activate-automatic-creation-of-electronic-invoices">Activate automatic creation of electronic invoices</h4>
<p>Go to <strong>Accounts receivable</strong> &gt; <strong>Customers</strong> &gt; <strong>All customers</strong>, and open a customer record in <strong>Edit</strong> mode. Then, on the <strong>Invoice and delivery</strong> FastTab, in the <strong>E-invoice</strong> section, find the <strong>eInvoice register</strong> option. If this option is set to <strong>Yes</strong>, the system automatically creates the record on the <strong>Electronic customer invoices</strong> list page. For more information, see the <a href="#einvoiceregister">Electronic invoice register</a> section later in this topic.</p>
<p><img src="media/emea-ita-electronic-invocies-customer-e-invoice.png" alt="E-invoice section on the Invoice and delivery FastTab of a customer record"></p>
<p>In the <strong>E-invoice</strong> section, you can also set the <strong>eInvoice attachment</strong> option to <strong>Yes</strong>. In this case, after you print an invoice (either during or after posting), the system automatically attaches the PDF file to the invoice and electronic invoice (see the <a href="#einvoiceregister">Electronic invoice register</a> section), and the file is included in the XML file (<strong>Allegati</strong> block).</p>
<h3 id="items">Items</h3>
<p>If there are product lines on an invoice, the <strong>CodiceArticolo</strong> block is filled in based on product data. This data includes the product bar code, the internal product number or item number, and the external item description. This information can be found by selecting options in the <strong>Related information</strong> group on the <strong>Sell</strong> tab on the Action Pane of the <strong>Released products</strong> page (<strong>Product information management</strong> &gt; <strong>Products</strong> &gt; <strong>Released products</strong>).</p>
<p>The <strong>CodiceTipo</strong> field is set according to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is a bar code, this field is set to <strong>EAN</strong>.</li>
<li>If there isn't a bar code, and the record on the <strong>External item description</strong> page exists for the product and the customer, this field is set to the value from the <strong>Description</strong> field.</li>
<li>If there isn't a bar code, and the record on the <strong>External item description</strong> page doesn't exist for the product, this field is set to the <strong>Codice Art. fornitore</strong> text.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>CodiceValore</strong> field is set according to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is a bar code, this field is set to the bar code.</li>
<li>If there isn't a bar code, and the record on the <strong>External item description</strong> page exists for the product and the customer, this field is set to the value from <strong>External item number</strong> field.</li>
<li>If there isn't a bar code, and the record on the <strong>External item description</strong> page doesn't exist for the product and customer, this field is set to the value from the <strong>Item number</strong> field.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="digitalcert">Digital certificates</h3>
<p>Go to <strong>Accounts receivable</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Electronic signature certificates</strong> to electronically sign electronic invoices by using a certificate of either the <strong>Company</strong> type or the <strong>User</strong> type.</p>
<p><img src="media/emea-ita-electronic-invocies-certificate.png" alt="Electronic signature certificates page"></p>
<p>The party that is issuing invoices must use a qualified signature certificate to sign each FatturaPA file that is transmitted to the Sistema di Interscambio (SdI) exchange system. A qualified signature certificate can be obtained from one of the certifiers in the <a href="http://www.digitpa.gov.it/firma-digitale/certificatori-accreditati">list of authorized certifiers</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance supports the <strong>XAdES-BES</strong> signature format. To enable Finance to support FatturaPA, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>On client computers, in the <strong>Application server machine</strong> field of the <strong>Personal</strong> node, install and configure digital certificates that have private and public keys.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>You can complete the installation and configuration by using standard Windows functionality.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Define company-level certificates and user-level certificates, as required.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="destination">Destination for XML file output</h3>
<p>If XML files must be sent as output to a specific place when invoices are posted (for example, if they must be sent to a SharePoint folder), set up a document type, and then set up a destination. For more information about these steps, see <a href="https://docs.wika.com/en-us/dynamics365/supply-chain/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/configure-document-management">Configure document management (This is an external linThis link was changed due to HTMLfromRepoGenerator)</a> and <a href="../../dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-destinations.md">Electronic reporting (ER) destinations</a>.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The <strong>Print invoice</strong> option must be set to <strong>Yes</strong>. If the destination is set up, the status of the electronic invoice record for the invoice is automatically set to <strong>Sent</strong>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="releteddoc">Fill in data for related documents</h2>
<p>Companies can report additional information about some base documents that are related to invoices. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>DatiOrdineAcquisto</strong> block contains information that is related to the purchase order.</li>
<li>The <strong>DatiContratto</strong> block contains information that is related to the contract.</li>
<li>The <strong>DatiConvenzione</strong> block contains information that is related to the agreement.</li>
<li>The <strong>DatiRicezione</strong> block contains information that is related to data about the reception phase. This data is present in the management system that is used by the PA (tax agencies).</li>
<li>The <strong>DatiFattureCollegate</strong> block contains information that is related to invoices that were previously transmitted and that the current document is connected to. This block is used for cases where a credit note and/or invoice is forwarded in accordance with previous advance payment invoices.</li>
</ul>
<p>To enable the system to enter information in these blocks, set the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the <strong>Sales order</strong> page (<strong>Accounts receivable</strong> &gt; <strong>Orders</strong> &gt; <strong>All sales orders</strong>), in the <strong>Header</strong> view, on the <strong>Setup</strong> FastTab, set the fields in the <strong>Base document</strong> section.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Free text invoice</strong> page (<strong>Accounts receivable</strong> &gt; <strong>Invoices</strong> &gt; <strong>All free text invoices</strong>), in the <strong>Header</strong> view, on the <strong>General</strong> FastTab, set the fields in the <strong>Base document</strong> section.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Project proposal</strong> page (<strong>Project management and accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Projects</strong> &gt; <strong>All projects</strong>), on the Action Pane, on the <strong>Manage</strong> tab, in the <strong>Bill</strong> group, select <strong>Invoice proposal</strong>, and then set the fields in the <strong>Base document</strong> section.</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>As the following table shows, data from the fields in the <strong>Base document</strong> section is sent as output from different blocks, depending on the value of the <strong>Base document</strong> field.</p>
<table>
