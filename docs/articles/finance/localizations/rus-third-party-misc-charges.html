<h1 id="third-party-miscellaneous-charges">Third party miscellaneous charges</h1>


<p>This topic explains how to handle services that are purchased though a separate invoice as miscellaneous charges. The cost of these services can be included in the cost price of the purchased goods or written off as a cost, like the miscellaneous charges that are defined in the invoice for the purchase of goods. Additionally, the debt on these services can be redrawn to third parties, such as customers or vendors. In this case, a facture is created that won't be included in the sales book or purchase book.</p>
<p>You must purchase an item of the <strong>Service</strong> type to do the accounting as a miscellaneous charge that you will allocate later. You must also specify item-related parameters for the miscellaneous charges code.</p>
<p>There are three modes of miscellaneous charges allocation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Include to the cost price</strong> – Allocate miscellaneous charges to other item invoices, so that the allocations can be included in an item's cost price. The allocation base is the invoice lines. The allocation causes the item's cost to be adjusted.</li>
<li><strong>Redraw debt</strong> – Allocate miscellaneous charges to redraw debt to third parties. The allocation base is the counteragent (customer or vendor) that the debt is reissued on. The allocation causes the system to create invoices for payment and factures for the selected counteragent.</li>
<li><strong>Write-off to cost</strong> – Allocate miscellaneous charges to the ledger account. The allocation base is the ledger account. The allocation causes the charges amount to be written off to the selected account.</li>
</ul>
