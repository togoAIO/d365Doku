<h3 id="e-invoicing-feature-setup">e-Invoicing feature setup</h3>
<p>&quot;The e-Invoicing feature&quot; is the generic name for the resource that is configured and published to consume the Electronic invoicing add-on server. The setup of the e-Invoicing feature combines, among other things, the use of Electronic reporting (ER) configuration formats to create configurable export and import files, and the use of actions and action flows to enable the creation of configurable rules to send requests, import responses, and parse the response contents.</p>
<p>Because of variations in invoice formats and action flows, the e-Invoicing feature setup is country/region-dependent.</p>

<p>During the regular submission process, communication between the client and the Electronic invoicing add-on is bidirectional. The purpose is to accomplish two main tasks during submission of electronic documents:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send all electronic documents that are pending submission from Finance, and that have the correct status for submission and meet the selection criteria.</li>
<li>Import, into Finance, the response that the Electronic invoicing add-on returns for previously submitted electronic documents. After import, the responses are parsed, and the status of the business documents is updated accordingly.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can submit business documents either manually or based on your schedule requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Organization administration &gt; Periodic &gt; Electronic documents &gt; Submit electronic documents</strong>.</li>
<li>For the first submission of any document, always set the <strong>Resubmit documents</strong> option to <strong>No</strong>. If you must resubmit a document through the service, set this option to <strong>Yes</strong>.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Records to include</strong> FastTab, select <strong>Filter</strong> to open the <strong>Inquiry</strong> dialog box, where you can build a query to select documents for submission.</li>
</ol>

<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>The value that is shown in the <strong>Submission status</strong> column represents the status that is related to the completion of the submission process itself. It indicates whether the flow of actions that is configured in RCS was run until the end, regardless of whether the electronic document was approved or rejected. The value in the <strong>Submission status</strong> column doesn't represent the status of the submitted document. You can view the status of the submitted document (that is, whether the document was approved or rejected) on the <strong>Processing action log</strong> FastTab in the submission log details, as described next.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>On the Action Pane, select <strong>Inquiries &gt; Submission details</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>View the submission log details.</p>
<p><img src="media/e-invoicing-services-get-started-view-submission-log-form.png" alt="Submission log details"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The results that are shown in the submission log depend on how the e-Invoicing feature was set up in RCS. However, regardless of the setup, the submission log always has three FastTabs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Processing actions</strong> – This FastTab shows the execution log for the actions that are configured in the feature version that was set up in RCS. The <strong>Status</strong> column shows whether the action was successfully run.</li>
<li><strong>Action files</strong> – This FastTab shows the intermediate files that were generated during execution of the actions. You can select <strong>View</strong> to download the file and view its contents.</li>
<li><strong>Processing action log</strong> – This FastTab shows the results of the communication between the Electronic invoicing add-on and the target web service. It also shows what was returned by the web service processing.</li>
