<p>An invoice-facture is a document that certifies the actual shipment of goods or services, and their cost. An invoice-facture is issued (sent) by the seller (contractor or performer) to the buyer (customer) after the buyer has accepted all the goods or services. An invoice-facture has two purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Confirmation that the order or work has been completed</li>
<li>Confirmation of the amount of value-added tax (VAT) that was paid, so that the amount can be credited later</li>
</ul>
<p>An invoice-facture can be processed in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on a purchase order or sales order</li>
<li>Based on a posted vendor or customer invoice</li>
<li>Based on a purchase product receipt</li>
<li>Based on a sales packing slip</li>
<li>Based on a sales free-text invoice</li>
</ul>
