<p>In Austria, all cash payments should be signed by an external device or service, and they should be securely stored. In the Czech Republic, all cash payments should be sent to the government portal for a fiscal signature. In both countries, a cash receipt should be issued where the signature is printed.</p>
<p>To support these country-specific requirements, Dynamics 365 Finance lets you integrate with a third-party fiscal service that complies with specific requirements for cash payment control in various countries or regions.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>It's assumed that the third-party fiscal service meets all other country-specific legal requirements about registered transactions. You're responsible for correctly setting up and administering the fiscal service.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="available-configurations">Available configurations</h2>
<p>The formats of the cash receipt, the XML request to the fiscal service, and the XML response from the fiscal service are configured as Electronic reporting (ER) configurations that are stored in the Shared asset library in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS).

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Third-party services or other services that you configure here don&#39;t require certification, and they might not meet Microsoft privacy standards.

<h4 id="important-notices">Important notices</h4>
<p>In the following scenarios, the tax amounts that are related to the payment amount can be reliably identified from the posted transactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the cash payment that is automatically posted when a cash on delivery (COD) invoice (COD terms of payment) is posted. In this case, tax amounts that are sent are equal to the tax amounts that are produced by an invoice posting.</li>
<li>For the cash prepayment that is manually posted from the Customer payment journal, when sales tax amounts are calculated and posted from the payment journal. (Tax amounts that are posted from a prepayment are always sent, regardless of the setting of the <strong>Register tax amount</strong> check box.)</li>
</ul>
<p>You should consult the local tax authority to identify the requirements for registering tax amounts that are related to a cash payment in the cash register. You should split methods of payment as required.</p>
<p>In the following scenarios, the tax amounts that are related to the payment amount can't be reliably identified from the posted transactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the cash payment that is manually posted from the Customer payment journal and settled against the previously posted invoice that contains a posted tax amount.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Cash register method of payment is configured to register tax amounts, a specific amount distribution logic calculates approximate tax amounts, based on the payment amount, in this scenario.</p>
<p>In these scenarios, the correct tax amounts are presented only in the posted invoice that is settled. Consult the local tax authority to identify the correct method for submitting the invoiced tax amounts to tax authority checks for these scenarios.</p>
