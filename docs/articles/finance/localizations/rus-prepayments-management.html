<p>Sellers are legally required to pay value-added tax (VAT) from the prepayments that they receive from customers (buyers). They must then issue prepayment factures to the customers. Customers can then deduct the VAT, based on the prepayment facture that they receive from a seller.</p>

<h3 id="recover-previously-accepted-deductible-vat-on-prepayment">Recover previously accepted deductible VAT on prepayment</h3>
<p>When a facture for the purchase of goods is received from a seller, the customer deducts the specified VAT on the purchase facture. In that same tax period, the facture must recover the VAT in the budget that was deducted from the received prepayment.</p>
<p>Additional actions are required after the incoming facture for goods, work, and services is posted. For example, if a seller makes a delivery, the incoming invoice and the incoming facture for this delivery are updated, and the invoice and the previously registered prepayment are settled.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Accounts payable</strong> &gt; <strong>Periodic tasks</strong> &gt; <strong>Purchase book</strong> &gt; <strong>Incoming VAT processing</strong>.</li>
<li>On the Action Pane, select <strong>Select</strong> to find the required payment, and then select <strong>OK</strong> to add lines for processing.</li>
<li>Mark the facture, and post the operation.</li>
<li>To restore previously deducted VAT from the received prepayment facture, you must configure the parameters for VAT recovery. Go to <strong>Accounts receivable</strong> &gt; <strong>Periodic tasks</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales book</strong> &gt; <strong>Parameters of VAT process</strong>, and create a line.</li>
<li>In the <strong>VAT operation code</strong> field, enter the operation code for VAT processing.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Operation type</strong> field, enter <strong>VAT restoration</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Restoration type</strong> field, select <strong>Prepayment journal voucher</strong>.</li>
<li>Set the <strong>By default</strong> option to <strong>Yes</strong> to indicate that this transaction is the default transaction for VAT processing.</li>
<li>Set the <strong>Include in book</strong> option to <strong>Yes</strong> if factures that are processed by using this transaction code should be included in the sales book.</li>
<li>To process the outgoing VAT, go to <strong>Accounts receivable</strong> &gt; <strong>Periodic tasks</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales book</strong> &gt; <strong>Outgoing VAT processing</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For settled payments where the incoming VAT was previously processed, the factures have a transaction type of <strong>Prepayment's storno</strong>. The facture number corresponds to the number of the registered prepayment facture. The amount of VAT to recover equals the amount of the processed incoming VAT on the received goods that falls in the settled part of the invoice.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Mark the facture, and post the operation. The system creates a tax transaction and a general ledger transaction for the processed tax amount.</li>
</ol>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The VAT recovery general ledger transaction is a reversal of the VAT deduction general ledger transaction:</p>
<p><strong>Debit 76 [Other debts and liabilities] / VAT on prepayment – Credit 68 [Taxes] / VAT – on VAT amount</strong></p>
</div>
<ol start="12">
<li>Go to <strong>Accounts receivable</strong> &gt; <strong>Periodic tasks</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales book</strong> &gt; <strong>VAT processing log</strong> to view the processed facture.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Accounts receivable</strong> &gt; <strong>Periodic tasks</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales book</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales books journal</strong>. Update the sales book, and verify that the facture is reflected in the Sales books journal for the processed amount.</li>
</ol>
<p>By default, if there were several VAT restorations for the same prepayment facture in the same period, the prepayment facture will be reflected on several line in the Sales books journal. Use the <strong>Group by factures</strong> option when you print the sales book. In that way, the facture report will reflect one line that has the total value of the VAT that was recovered in the period.</p>
<p>You can't close the Sales books journal if there are any incoming prepayment factures in the period that VAT hasn't been restored for.</p>
<p>You can't cancel the prepayment settlement and the invoice if the VAT was restored in the period. You must first cancel the VAT recovery in this period.
To cancel the VAT recovery, use the <strong>Sales book (Canceling processed VAT)</strong> page (<strong>Accounts receivable</strong> &gt; <strong>Periodic tasks</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales book</strong> &gt; <strong>Canceling processed VAT</strong>).</p>
<p>You can't cancel the processing of incoming VAT unless the VAT recovery is canceled on the prepayment that is settled to the invoice.</p>
