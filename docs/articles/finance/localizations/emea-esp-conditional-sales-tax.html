<p>For legal entities in Spain, if a promissory note payment for a vendor or a bill of exchange payment for a customer is settled against an invoice that includes conditional tax, and you protest the settlement, the cancellation of conditional tax is registered with a voucher that is related to the settlement cancellation voucher.</p>
<p><em>Conditional sales tax</em> is sales tax that is paid proportionally to the actual amount that is paid on an invoice. For more information about conditional tax, see <a href="../general-ledger/indirect-taxes-overview.html">Sales tax overview</a>. A <em>promissory note</em> is a written agreement in which the maker of the note promises to pay a specific amount at a specific time. A <em>bill of exchange</em> is a written or electronic order from a customer that specifies that another party (usually a bank) should pay a stated amount to the company. For more information about bills of exchange, see <a href="../accounts-receivable/set-up-bills-exchange.html">Set up bills of exchange</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conditional-sales-tax-for-protested-promissory-notes">Conditional sales tax for protested promissory notes</h2>
<p>When a user posts a Redraw promissory note journal, transactions that were previously posted are reversed if a promissory note was settled against a vendor invoice. If the invoice included conditional tax when it was settled against a promissory note, a tax transaction for the conditional tax is posted. For legal entities in Spain, if the promissory note was settled against an invoice that includes conditional tax, the tax transaction is reversed when a Redraw promissory note journal is posted. To view reverse transactions, go to <strong>Voucher transactions</strong> &gt; <strong>Related vouchers</strong>.</p>
