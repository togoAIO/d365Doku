<h2 id="generating-an-act-of-adjustment">Generating an Act of adjustment</h2>
<p>An Act of adjustment is a document that is used to analyze settlements with the counterparty (customer or vendor). The parties that are involved agree on the recurrence of the document and its level of detail. The document contains information about accounts receivable or accounts payable at the beginning and end of the period, invoices that are issued or received, payments that are made, and netting transactions that are posted during the reporting period. An Act of adjustment can be generated in the context of invoices or agreements, or for the customer or vendor as a whole.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The settlement is the only basis for determining the timeliness of debt repayment, and for determining value-added tax (VAT), the tax base for income tax, and other details. Therefore, an Act of adjustment reflects the documents of debt repayment in the context of the documents that form the debt.</p>
</div>

<p>An Act of adjustment contains the following data in the context of the customer or vendor and its agreements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The expanded total balance on the counterparty (agreement) at the beginning and the end of the period. The expanded total balance is the balance of invoices or credit notes, and the balance on advances or refunds.</li>
<li>Information about unpaid invoices of the previous period (payables or receivables), their payment, and their offset (settlement) in the current period.</li>
<li>Information about received or shipped invoices or credit notes for the period that is under review, together with information about their payment and netting (settlement).</li>
<li>Information about advances or refunds (unsettled payments of the current period).</li>
