<h1 id="posting-definitions-in-the-public-sector">Posting definitions in the public sector</h1>


<p>This article provides examples of public sector posting definitions that you can use to create subledger journal lines for originating transactions that meet selected criteria. Examples include budget appropriations, pooled cash settlements, write-offs, COD settlements, advanced ledger entries, general ledger year-end close, and proprietary funds.</p>
<p>This article describes the posting definitions functionality available for the public sector. Before you read this topic, you should be familiar with posting definitions.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-use-these-examples-of-public-sector-posting-definitions">How do I use these examples of public sector posting definitions?</h2>
<p>You can set up the examples in this article on the <strong>Posting definitions</strong> page. Each example contains these sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posting definition – Match criteria</li>
<li>Posting definition – Generated entries</li>
<li>Transactions with the accounts, dimension values, and amounts</li>
<li>Ledger entries generated from the posting definition</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <strong>Match criteria</strong> area, when a match occurs between the accounts and dimension values for the posting definition and the accounts and dimension values on the transaction, ledger entries are generated. These entries are based on the <strong>generated entries</strong> for the posting definition.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>To associate a posting definition with a specific transaction type, use the <strong>Transaction posting definitions</strong> page. After you associate a posting definition with a transaction type and select the <strong>Use posting definitions</strong> accounting rule on the <strong>General ledger parameters</strong> page, all transactions of the selected transaction type must use posting definitions.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="example-budget-appropriations">Example: Budget appropriations</h2>
<p>For public sector organizations, original budget balances are recorded as either appropriations for expenses or estimated revenues. The original budget balances are used to track available budget balances against expenditures and the actual revenues that are collected.</p>
<p>A posting definition is created to support the recording of budget register entries to the general ledger, and a transaction posting definition is set up for budget register entries that have a budget type of <strong>Original budget</strong>.</p>

<p>In this example, the fund dimension and account part of the expense account structure match the posting definition criteria. Therefore, when 101-606400-OU_1-OU_3566-Training is evaluated, the generated ledger entries are created.</p>
<h2 id="examples-pooled-cash-settlements">Examples: Pooled cash settlements</h2>
<p>Pooled cash accounting consists of amounts that are deposited by individual funds into a combined ledger account. This improves the control and custody over liquid assets, and promotes the efficient management of excess funds. These amounts can be managed by using a Treasurer’s fund. Therefore, the appropriate proportional amount of the pooled cash and investment balances must be reported for each fund that participates in the pool. To guarantee this, appropriate due-to and due-from entries must be added to the settlements that transfer amounts from one fund to another to accomplish the settlement.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>No error message is displayed if a posting definition for settlements isn't specified or match criteria in the posting definition aren't available. Installations that don't use pooled cash settlements or don't require balancing entries on the settlement voucher don't have to set up posting definitions for settlements when posting definitions are enabled for other transactions.</p>
</div>
<p>For accounts payable settlements, vendor payables in one or more funds are used to record the appropriate fund equity transactions in the Treasurer’s fund. For accounts receivable settlements, the customer credit from the payments in the Treasurer’s fund is used to settle the receivables in one or more funds. The vendor balance or customer balance posting entries on the transactions that are being settled are automatically reversed. The use of posting definitions for settlement is optional. The posting definitions are applied at the time of settlement to generate the additional ledger transactions for due-to and due-from entries to balance the settlement voucher by fund.</p>
<p>You can use posting definitions for the following settlement transaction types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vendor payment journals, which include vendor payments against invoices, reimbursements, and general ledger credit vouchers and credit memos against invoices</li>
<li>Promissory notes, which include payments that use the draw, redraw, remit, and settlement of promissory notes</li>
<li>Customer payment journals, which include customer payments, customer general ledger credit vouchers, and credit notes against free text invoices, project invoices, interest notes, and collection letter transactions</li>
</ul>
<p>To set up posting definitions for vendor payment journals, promissory notes, and customer payment journals, on the <strong>Posting definitions</strong> page, in the <strong>Module</strong> field, select <strong>Bank</strong>. Then, on the <strong>Transaction posting definitions</strong> page, on the <strong>Bank</strong> tab, you can select the appropriate transaction types to associate with the posting definitions.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>A single posting definition, if it's widely defined, can be used for most vendor, and customer settlement scenarios. The single posting definition must still be associated with both vendor and customer payment journals on the <strong>Bank</strong> tab.</p>
</div>
<p>You can specify a different posting definition for a specific bank and method of payment for vendor and customer payment journals.</p>
<p>Before posting definitions are applied on settlements, you should complete the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Associate each vendor or customer who has the Treasurer’s fund (999) on the <strong>Financial dimensions</strong> FastTab of the vendor’s or customer’s details page. Vendor or customer payments can then be generated in the Treasurer’s fund against the vendor or customer summary account that is specified in the vendor or customer posting profiles.</li>
<li>To set the default fund, in Accounts receivable, on the <strong>Customer groups</strong> page, on the Action Pane, click <strong>Setup</strong>, and then click <strong>Default financial dimensions</strong>. The Treasurer’s fund will then become the default fund when new customers are associated with a customer group.</li>
<li>Associate the Treasurer’s fund with each bank account that is used in settlements. The posted bank account can then be in balance, by fund, with the vendor or customer payment.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also complete one of the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option A:</strong> Specify a single due-to account in the Treasurer’s fund for all funds.</li>
<li><strong>Option B:</strong> Specify a different due-to account in the Treasurer’s fund for each fund.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="option-a-specify-a-single-due-to-account-for-all-funds">Option A: Specify a single due-to account for all funds</h3>
<p>You can specify a single due-to account in the Treasurer’s fund for all funds. In this case, a single global match criterion addresses all funds (except the Treasurer’s fund), and you must specify the following match criteria and generated entries on the posting definition.</p>

<p>You must add <strong>Match criteria</strong> rows for each fund that has generated entries, to reflect the appropriate fund balancing entry and the equity account of the fund in the Treasurer’s fund.</p>
<p>From the vendor or customer payment journal, enter the vendor or customer accounts, or create a payment proposal, and then select the invoices to pay. When the journal is posted, the vendor or customer balance posting entries on both the invoice and payment are matched against the posting definition for settlement. If match criteria are found, the generated due-to and due-from entries are added to the settlement voucher.</p>
<p>The following vouchers are representative of a typical invoice, payment, and settlement scenario.</p>

<p>In addition to the example earlier in this section, posting definitions for settlements that are associated with the customer payment journal transaction type can also be applied in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounts receivable write-offs</li>
<li>Accounts receivable free text invoice cash-on-delivery (cash payment) settlements</li>
</ul>
<p>Accounts receivable write-offs can use posting definitions that are defined for settlement. Therefore, the general ledger credit journal voucher can be generated when balances are posted by fund. Both ledger and customer account type entries on the journal lines are evaluated against the posting definition for settlement. Both use the posting definition that is assigned to the transaction type on the <strong>Accounts receivable</strong> tab on the <strong>Transaction posting definitions</strong> page. Depending on how the write-off is designed to be run, the posting definition for settlement might require additional match criteria.</p>
<p>When the write-off posting definition is set up to write off balances to an allowance for the Doubtful receivables contra asset account, the posting definition for settlement can also be used for write-offs, provided that the match criterion is already set up for balance sheet accounts that have a mask for the main account. (For more information, see earlier examples, such as the &quot;Settlement posting definition – Match criteria&quot; section.)</p>
<p>When the write-off posting definition is set up to reverse the originating revenue account, the posting definition for settlement must have the appropriate match criteria for revenue accounting structures, specifically the due-to and due-from accounting entries on the generated entries. For each fund that isn't in the Treasurer’s fund (999), the following entries must be present on the posting definition for settlement.</p>

<h2 id="accounts-receivable-free-text-invoice-cash-on-delivery-cash-payment-settlement-example">Accounts receivable free text invoice cash-on-delivery (cash payment) settlement example</h2>
<p>Free text invoices use terms of payment where the payment method is set to <strong>COD</strong> and cash payment is enabled. Therefore, they immediately settle themselves at the time of posting without having to use the payment journal. When this kind of settlement occurs, a credit note is created. This note uses the specified cash account on the terms of payment offset and the financial dimensions on the customer summary account. In this kind of settlement, the appropriate receivable accounts that are specified on the invoice aren't automatically reversed. Therefore, the posting definition for settlement must address the reversal of the customer balance posting entries on the invoice and credit, in addition to generating the due-to and due-from entries for settlement.</p>
<p>To use posting definitions for settlement in this scenario, complete the following additional setup tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a distinct method of payment for free text invoices that will be settled through this method.</li>
<li>Create a new posting definition for the free text invoice cash-on-delivery settlement.</li>
<li>Associate the new posting definition (for the customer payment journal against the specific method of payment) on the <strong>Bank</strong> tab on the <strong>Transaction posting definitions</strong> page. To apply the posting definition setup specified for this kind of settlement, select this unique method of payment and the COD/cash payment terms of payment on the invoice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, in the posting definition, enter the following match criteria and generated entries for the Treasurer’s fund (999).</p>

<h2 id="example-advanced-ledger-entries">Example: Advanced ledger entries</h2>
<p>When you create advanced ledger entries, you must select a default posting definition. Then, for each advanced ledger entry line, you can either use the default posting definition or select another one. The posting definitions generate the accounting distributions and subledger journal entries that create, adjust, or reverse the ledger entries and update the ledger accounts. You set up each posting definition for the General ledger app. However, you don't associate the posting definition with a transaction type, as you do for other posting definitions. Instead, you select the posting definition in the advanced ledger entry.</p>
<p>In this scenario, Accounts payable invoice AP_0949 was mistakenly posted to Capital improvement fund 300-12300-51002 instead of General fund 100-39810-51001. The following example shows how an advanced ledger entry can use a posting definition to debit the Capital improvement fund and credit the General fund.</p>

<h2 id="examples-general-ledger-year-end-close">Examples: General ledger year-end close</h2>
<p>Organizations use posting definitions in the year-end closing of the general ledger accounts. Posting definitions can be used to close the accounts to fund balances or retained earnings, based on the fund (dimension) class attribute, together with the account close type attribute. Posting definitions are required to close the general ledger accounts and to transfer balances to the opening period in the new fiscal year.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>To use posting definitions for year-end closing and opening, you need to complete the following setup tasks:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>On the <strong>General ledger parameters</strong> page, in the <strong>Ledger</strong> section, on the <strong>Fiscal year close</strong> FastTab, select the <strong>Create closing transactions during transfer</strong> option.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Main accounts - chart of accounts: %1</strong> page, create a closing account.</li>
</ul>
