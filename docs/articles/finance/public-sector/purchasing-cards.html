<h1 id="purchasing-cards">Purchasing cards</h1>


<p>Agencies use purchasing cards so that employees can procure goods and services without using the standard purchase requisition process. The pages and fields that are related to purchasing cards provide a mechanism for tracking purchases. Each purchase that an employee makes by using a purchasing card is recorded on a vendor invoice. However, the invoice isn't paid by using a check or electronic payment to the vendor that provided the goods or services. Instead, each invoice of this type is associated with another vendor invoice that is created to pay the vendor that provides the purchasing card services (that is, the financial institution). The card purchases are paid off when the balance that is owed to the purchasing card services provider is paid each month.</p>
<h2 id="enable-purchasing-card-pages-and-fields">Enable purchasing card pages and fields</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Accounts payable</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts payable parameters</strong>.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Invoice</strong> tab, set the <strong>Activate Purchasing cards</strong> option to <strong>Yes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="enter-purchasing-card-records-for-employees">Enter purchasing card records for employees</h2>
<p>You must enter information about the purchasing cards that have been issued to employees so that they can purchase goods or services. This information will appear on vendor invoices. When a purchasing card is added to a bank account, vendor invoices can recognize the credit card as valid during invoice processing.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Cash and bank management</strong> &gt; <strong>Common</strong> &gt; <strong>Bank accounts</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the list page, select the bank account for the purchasing card services provider.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the Action Pane, on the <strong>Set up</strong> tab, select <strong>Purchasing cards</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Bank purchasing card</strong> page, select <strong>New</strong> to create a purchasing card record.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enter the following information about the purchasing card:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the <strong>Purchasing card reference number</strong> field, enter the reference number for the credit card. For example, enter the last four digits.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>After you've saved the purchasing card reference number, you can't change it.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Card holder name</strong> field, enter the cardholder's name as it appears on the purchasing card.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Employee</strong> field, select the employee that the card was issued to.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optional: In the <strong>Valid from</strong> field, enter the date when the card was issued to the employee.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optional: In the <strong>Expiry date</strong> field, enter the date when the card expires.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optional: In the <strong>Credit limit</strong> field, enter the maximum amount that can be charged to the card.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="set-up-a-posting-definition-for-vendor-invoices-that-track-employee-purchases">Set up a posting definition for vendor invoices that track employee purchases</h2>
<p>You must create a posting definition for the vendor invoices that you enter to record purchases that are made by using a purchasing card. When these invoices are posted, balancing entries for the expenditure are created in General ledger. When a vendor invoice is settled, it's moved to the history, but a payment to the vendor isn't generated. You use this posting definition when you import invoices from an external file and when you manually enter vendor invoices for employee purchases.</p>
<p>Optional: You can set the posting definition so that it's used by default when you create vendor invoices to record purchasing card transactions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Accounts payable</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts payable parameters</strong>.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Invoice</strong> tab, in the <strong>Default posting definition for record purchase</strong> field, select the posting definition that you want to use as the default posting definition.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="overview-processing-invoices-for-purchasing-card-transactions">Overview: Processing invoices for purchasing card transactions</h2>
<p>After you've set up your system for purchasing cards, you can create an invoice for a vendor, or financial institution, that provides purchasing card services. You can also create other invoices to track the purchases that are made by cardholders. After you receive the monthly purchasing card statement from your financial institution, you can distribute it to employees who made purchases during the billing period. Typically, these employees will verify the transactions, and provide receipts or invoices that support their purchases.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a vendor invoice to pay the purchasing card services provider. You will generate a check for this vendor invoice to pay the balance on the purchasing card statement.</li>
<li>Create other vendor invoices to record purchases that have been made by cardholders.</li>
</ol>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Typically, you will use the vendor invoice data entities to publish vendor invoice data in the system.</p>
</div>
