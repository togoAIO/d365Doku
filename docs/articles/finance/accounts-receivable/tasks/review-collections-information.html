<p>This topic explains how to review collections information as well as various setup options and collections transactions. This procedure uses the USMF demo company.</p>
<h2 id="create-customer-pools">Create customer pools</h2>
<ol>
<li>In the navigation pane, go to <strong>Modules &gt; Credit and collections &gt; Setup &gt; Customer pools</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Use this page to set up customer pools, which are queries that define a group of customer accounts that can be displayed and managed for collections or aging processes. Use customer pools to filter information on the <strong>Collections</strong> list page and on related list pages. You can also use customer pools to filter the customer accounts that are included when aging snapshots are created.</li>
<li>You can use customer pools to filter the customer accounts that are included when aging snapshots are created.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Select <strong>New</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Pool ID</strong> field, type a value.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Pool description</strong> field, type a value.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Select pool criteria</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Criteria</strong> field, type a value.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Preview customer pool</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="create-collections-agents">Create collections agents</h2>
<ol>
<li>In the navigation pane, go to <strong>Modules &gt; Credit and collections &gt; Setup &gt; Collections agents</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Use this page to set up workers as collections agents and optionally assign customer pools to them. A <em>collections agent</em> is a person who works with customers to make sure that payments are collected in a timely manner.</li>
<li>Collections agents that are set up in this page are automatically added to a collections team. If a team is selected in the <strong>Team</strong> field in the <strong>Accounts receivable parameters</strong> page, collections agents are added to that team. If a team is not selected, a new team named Collections is created automatically and the collections agents are added to that team.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Select the desired agent, then select <strong>Add</strong> in the page.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Pool ID</strong> field, select the desired record in the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Select or clear the <strong>Default pool</strong> check box.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Select this option to include all customer pools in filter lists for the selected collections agent. If this option is not selected, only the customer pools that are assigned to the collections agent are available in filter lists.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="create-aging-period-definition">Create aging period definition</h2>
<ol>
<li>In the navigation pane, go to <strong>Modules &gt; Credit and collections &gt; Setup &gt; Aging period definitions</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You can use aging period definitions to analyze the maturity of customer accounts and vendor accounts, based on a date that you enter. Each aging period that you set up for the aging period definition corresponds to a column on the list page or in the form or report when the analysis is performed.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Select <strong>New</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Aging period definition</strong> field, type a value.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Description</strong> field, type a value.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Specify the period name, unit, and interval for each aging period to include in the aging period definition. The line that has 0 (zero) in the Unit field represents the date that the analysis is run. Lines before zero will have -1, and lines after zero will have 1 as a default entry in the Unit field, but can be changed. Select <strong>Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong> to rearrange the lines. The 0 (zero) line cannot be moved.</li>
<li>Place the pointer where you want to insert a new line and then select <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Select an indicator to represent the aging period in the <strong>Collections</strong> form and list page. For example, you might select a green indicator for a current period, a yellow indicator for a 30-days-past period, and a red indicator for a 90-days-past period.</li>
<li>Select the printing direction for the aging period definition. This selection determines the order in which the columns appear on the Customer aging report or the Vendor aging report.
<ul>
<li>Forward – Print columns in the same order in which the headings appear in the table, starting with the top row.</li>
<li>Backward – Print columns in the reverse order in which the headings appear in the table, starting with the bottom row.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setup-collections-parameters">Setup collections parameters</h2>
<ol>
<li>In the navigation pane, go to <strong>Modules &gt; Credit and collections &gt; Setup &gt; Accounts receivable parameters</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Collections</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Expand or collapse the <strong>Collections defaults</strong> section.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Select an aging period definition for the default aging snapshot that will be used in the <strong>Collections</strong> form.</li>
<li>Select a team that collections agents are assigned to in the <strong>Collections agent</strong> form. Only teams that have a team type of Collections are displayed in the list.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Expand or collapse the <strong>Write-off</strong> section.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Select the journal name, which is set up for daily ledger journals, to use when a transaction is written off by using the <strong>Collections</strong> form or related list pages.</li>
<li>Select the default reason code to use when write-off transactions are created by using the <strong>Collections</strong> form or related list pages.</li>
<li>Select this option to create a separate journal line for sales tax amounts when write-off transactions are created by using the <strong>Collections</strong> page or related list pages. If you select this option, you can easily track the sales tax amounts that are involved in write-off transactions. You can track the sales tax amounts separately to help you more easily adjust your sales tax liability for the affected period.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Expand or collapse the <strong>Email template</strong> section.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Select the email template to use when you send an email message by using the <strong>E-mail &gt; Transactions</strong> to contact action in the <strong>Collections</strong> form.</li>
<li>Select the email template to use when you send a customer statement as an attachment to an email message by using the <strong>E-mail &gt; Statement</strong> to contact action in the <strong>Collections</strong> form.</li>

If a customer pool is selected, the aging snapshot process is applied only to the customer accounts that are part of the customer pool. The selected customer pool must be of the Aging snapshot type.</li>
<li>Select the type of date to base the aging snapshot on.
<ul>
<li>Transaction date – Age each transaction based on its transaction date.</li>

<li>Document date – Age each transaction based on its document date.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select the date to use as the current date for the aging snapshot. Aging periods are calculated based on this date.
<ul>
<li>Today's date – Use the system date. Use this option if processing is set up to occur in a recurring batch. If you use this date, the recurring batch can be run periodically and the system date at that time is used.</li>
<li>Selected date – Use a date that you specify. If you select this option, enter an aging date.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>Use this list page to view customer balances and aged amounts by aging period. This information is stored in an aging snapshot. The aging periods are determined by the aging period definition that is used. The aging period definition is taken from the customer pool, if one was specified for the pool query.
