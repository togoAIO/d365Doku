<h1 id="collections-process-automation">Collections process automation</h1>


<p>This topic describes the process of setting up collections process strategies that automatically identify customer invoices that require an email reminder, collection activity (such as a phone call), or a collection letter to be sent to the customer.</p>
<p>Organizations spend a significant amount of time researching aged balance reports, customer accounts, and open invoices to determine which customers need to be contacted about an open invoice or account balance. This research takes times away from a collection agent’s time spent communicating with customers to collect past due balances or resolving invoice disputes. Collections process automation lets you set up a strategy-based approach to your collection process. This helps you apply collection activities consistently by providing customized email reminders, or programmed process for sending collection letters.</p>
<h2 id="collections-process-setup">Collections process setup</h2>
<p>You can use the <strong>Collections process setup</strong> page (<strong>Credit and collections &gt; Setup &gt; Collections process setup</strong>) to create an automated collections process that will schedule activities, send email messages, and create and post customer collection letters. The process steps are based on the leading or oldest open invoice. Each step uses this invoice to determine what communication or activity should take place with a specific customer.</p>
<h3 id="process-hierarchy">Process hierarchy</h3>
<p>Each customer pool can only be assigned to one process hierarchy. The hierarchy rank of this step identifies which process will take precedence if a customer is included in more than one pool that has a process hierarchy assigned. The pool ID determines which customers will be assigned to the process.</p>
<p>The quiet days are used to ensure that a customer does not get contacted too frequently by the automated process.  For example, if the quiet days are set to two, a customer will not be contacted by the automated process for at least two days, even if the original leading invoice has been settled in full.</p>
<p>To exclude customers from the process automation if the account balance or invoice balance is less than a defined value, set the <strong>Exclude from process</strong> field to <strong>Yes</strong> and enter the amount value.</p>
<h2 id="process-details">Process details</h2>
<p><strong>Description</strong> is used to identify the purpose or name of the step in the hierarchy.</p>
<p><strong>Action type</strong> defines if the step will create an activity, send an email, or create a collection letter.</p>
<p><strong>Business document</strong> defines the template used to create the action type.  This can be an activity template, an email template, or a collection letter per customer.</p>
<p>The action types can be created on either before or after the invoice due date, based on the setting that's displayed in the <strong>Days in relation to the invoice due date</strong> column.</p>
<p>When you select an email action type, the recipient will be used to define if that is a customer, sales group, or collections agent contact. The value in the <strong>Business purpose contact</strong> field will then determine which contact from that customer's account will receive the communication.</p>
<h2 id="business-document-details">Business document details</h2>
<p>The business document details will vary based on the action type that's selected in the process details.  When the action type is an activity, the activity template details will be shown.  These details include the activity template name, the type of activity that will be created, the purpose of the activity, the number of days scheduled to complete the activity, and the details of the activity.  This activity will then link to the leading invoice that tells the recipient of the action that’s needed to complete the activity.</p>
<p>If the action type is an email in the process details, this section will contain two FastTabs.  The first is used to define the template ID, email description, default language, the user name that will be assigned to email messages that are automatically sent, and the associated senders email address. The second will allow the body of the email to be created after the values in the <strong>Language</strong> and <strong>Subject</strong> fields are saved by selecting <strong>Edit</strong>.  This will open a window that allows HTML content to be uploaded. You can also type the message that’s created manually in the lower left box of the window.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>An Outlook email can be saved with the desired body of the communication in HTML format. This can then be uploaded to implement the template. <br> <br> If the action type of collection letter is selected there will not be a business document detail section on the setup form.</p>
</div>
