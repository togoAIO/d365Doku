<p>This article describes the differences between reversing, deleting, voiding, and rejecting a payment. Additionally, it explains the two methods for reversing a vendor check.</p>
<p>Occasionally, after a vendor payment has been posted, the payment must be reversed. Reversal differs from deleting, voiding, or rejecting a payment. You can delete a payment only if its status is <strong>Created</strong>. This status indicates that the payment has been created but hasn't yet been generated. This limitation always applies, regardless of the method of payment. You can void unposted checks after they have been generated but before they have been posted. If the generated payment is done as an electronic fund transfer (EFT), you can reject the payment before it's posted. To reject a payment, change the <strong>Payment status</strong> value. A payment that has been voided or rejected can be regenerated after the <strong>Payment status</strong> value is changed back to <strong>None</strong>.</p>
<p>After a payment is posted, reversals are used. Payments that are made electronically can't be reversed after they have been posted. Instead, a new transaction must be created for the amount of the payment to get the liability back on the vendor's account. There are two methods for reversing posted checks. In one method, reversals are posted immediately when you click <strong>Payment reversal</strong> on the <strong>Check</strong> page. In the other method, when you click <strong>Payment reversal</strong> on the <strong>Check</strong> page, the reversal is sent to the check reversal journal in Cash and bank management, where a reviewer can then post or reject the reversal.</p>
<p>To learn which method your organization uses, view the <strong>Cash and bank management parameters</strong> page. If the <strong>Use review process for payment reversals</strong> option is set to <strong>Yes</strong>, reversals are sent to the check reversal journal for review. The following table describes how the check reversal methods differ.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>If your organization doesn't review check reversals before posting</th>
<th>If your organization reviews check reversals before posting</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>The check is reversed immediately when you click <strong>OK</strong> on the <strong>Check</strong> page.</td>
<td>The check isn't immediately reversed. A check reversal journal is created for review. If the check reversal journal is deleted, the check can be reversed again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The accounting entries for the original check are reversed.</td>
<td>The ledger account from the original check's accounting entry might not be posted. The financial dimensions from the original check’s journal are used as the default financial dimensions on the check reversal journal. You can change these default values. When the check reversal journal is posted, the main accounts for Accounts payable are entered automatically from the posting profiles, which might have changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The accounting structures that were used when the original check was posted are used to reverse the check, even if the account structure has been changed. The account combination isn't validated.</td>
<td>If an account structure changed after the original check was posted, a new financial dimension might be required for the reversal of the check. This financial dimension might not be entered automatically from the original payment's journal. The account combination is validated when the check reversal is posted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fixed dimensions aren't applied to the reversal, to help guarantee that the same ledger accounts are reversed.</td>
<td>Fixed dimensions are applied to the check reversal journal during posting. The financial dimension value might not exist in the accounting entry for the original check, depending on when the fixed dimension was defined.</td>
</tr>
