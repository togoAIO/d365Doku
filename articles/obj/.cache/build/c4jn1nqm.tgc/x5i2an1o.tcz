<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce version 10.0.10 and later, inbound and outbound operations in the point of sale (POS) replace the picking and receiving operation.</p>
<div class="NOTE" sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">In version 10.0.10 and later, any new features in the POS application that are related to receiving store inventory against purchase orders and transfer orders will be added to the inbound operations operation. If you're currently using the picking and receiving operation in POS, we recommend that you develop a strategy for moving from that operation to the new inbound and outbound operations. Although the picking and receiving operation won't be removed from the product, there will be no further investments in it, from a functional or performance perspective, after version 10.0.9.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="prerequisite-configure-an-asynchronous-document-framework" sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">Prerequisite: Configure an asynchronous document framework</h2>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="46">The outbound operation includes performance improvements to ensure that users who have high volumes of receipt postings across many stores or companies, and large inventory documents, can process those documents to Commerce headquarters (HQ) without experiencing time-outs or failures. These improvements require use of an asynchronous document framework.</p>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="48">When an asynchronous document framework is used, you can commit outbound document changes from POS to Commerce headquarters (HQ) and then move on to other tasks while the processing to Commerce headquarters (HQ) occurs in the background. You can check the status of the document through the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="48">Outbound operation</strong> document list page in POS to make sure that posting was successful. In the POS application, you can also use the outbound operation active document list to see any documents that could not be posted to Commerce headquarters (HQ). If a document fails, POS users can make corrections to it and then try again to process it to Commerce headquarters (HQ).</p>

<h2 id="overview" sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="84">Overview</h2>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="86">The outbound operation lets POS users perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="88">
<li sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="88">Post shipments for transfer order documents in cases where the user's store is the designated outbound warehouse.</li>

</ul>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="92">When the outbound operation is started from the POS application, a list page view appears. This view shows open transfer order documents that have inventory lines that the user's current store is intended to ship and fulfill. To find a select a document, users can scroll the list or use the search feature.</p>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="94">The outbound inventory document list has three tabs.</p>

<h3 id="over-delivery-shipping-validations" sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="125">Over-delivery shipping validations</h3>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="127">Validations occur during the receiving process for the document lines. They include validations for over-delivery. If a user tries to receive more inventory than was ordered on a purchase order, but either over-delivery isn't configured or the quantity that is received exceeds the over-delivery tolerance that is configured for the purchase order line, the user receives an error and isn't allowed to receive the excess quantity.</p>
<h3 id="underdelivery-close-lines" sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="129">Underdelivery close lines</h3>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="131">In Commerce version 10.0.12, functionality was added that lets POS users close or cancel remaining quantities during outbound order shipment if the outbound warehouse determines that it can't ship the full quantity that was requested. Quantities can also be closed or canceled later. To use this capability, the company must be configured to allow underdelivery of transfer orders. Additionally, an underdelivery percentage must be defined for the transfer order line.</p>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="133">To configure the company to allow underdelivery of transfer orders, in Commerce headquarters (HQ), go to <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="133">Inventory management &gt; Setup &gt; Inventory and warehouse management parameters</strong>. On the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="133">Inventory and warehouse management parameters</strong> page, on the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="133">Transfer orders</strong> tab, turn on the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="133">Accept underdelivery</strong> parameter. Then run the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="133">1070</strong> distribution scheduler job to sync the parameter changes to your store channel.</p>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="135">Underdelivery percentages for a transfer order line can be predefined on products as part of product configuration in Commerce Headquarters. Alternatively, they can be set or overwritten on a specific transfer order line through Commerce headquarters (HQ).</p>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="137">After an organization completes configuring transfer order underdelivery, POS users will see a new <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="137">Close remaining quantity</strong> option in the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="137">Details</strong> pane when they select an outbound transfer order line through the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="137">Outbound operation</strong> function. When the user completes the shipment by using the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="137">Finish fulfillment</strong> operation, they can send a request to Commerce headquarters (HQ) to cancel the remaining unshipped quantity. If the user closes the remaining quantity, Commerce performs a validation to verify that the quantity that is being canceled is within the underdelivery percentage tolerance defined on the transfer order line. If the underdelivery tolerance is exceeded, an error message is displayed and the user won't be able to close the remaining quantity until the previously shipped and &quot;ship now&quot; quantity meets or exceeds the underdelivery tolerance.</p>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="139">After the shipment is synced to Commerce headquarters (HQ), the quantities that are defined in the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="139">Ship now</strong> field for the transfer order line in POS are updated to a shipped status in Commerce headquarters (HQ). Any unshipped quantities that previously would have been considered &quot;ship remain&quot; quantities (that is, quantities that will be shipped later) are considered canceled quantities instead. The &quot;ship remain&quot; quantity for the transfer order line is set to <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="139">0</strong> (zero), and the line is considered fully shipped.</p>
<h3 id="shipping-location-controlled-items" sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="141">Shipping location-controlled items</h3>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="143">If the items that are being shipped are location-controlled, users can choose the location that they want to issue the inventory from during the shipping process. We recommend that you configure a default issue location for your store warehouse, to make this process more efficient. Even if a default location is configured, users can override the issue location on selected lines as they require.</p>

If blank receipt locations aren't allowed for an item, the POS application shows an error and requires that a location be entered before the receipt can be posted.</p>

<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="178">When asynchronous document processing is used, the receipt is submitted through an asynchronous document framework. The time that it takes for the document to be posted depends on the size of the document (the number of lines) and the general processing traffic that is occurring on the server.
