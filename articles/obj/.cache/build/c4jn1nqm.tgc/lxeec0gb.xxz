<td>Data partitions were introduced in Dynamics AX 2012 R2 to enable data isolation. In a common scenario, a company has subsidiaries, and the data from one subsidiary should not be visible to another subsidiary, even though both subsidiaries are managed by the same IT department. However, extra scripts and management overhead throughout the program were required in order to create new partitions and populate them with data, and to back up partition data. In the cloud, where we have access to platform as a service (PaaS) database services (Microsoft Azure SQL Database), it's much more efficient to use a database as the isolation container than to do isolation in the program. Regardless of whether data partitioning is required for subsidiaries, for multiple tenants, or just for scale, we believe that the scenarios can be handled better through multiple instances of Finance and Operations.</td>

For a description of the feature, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa834382(v=ax.10).aspx">Company accounts and Virtual company accounts</a>. The feature works by grouping tables into collections that are assigned to virtual companies, which are groups of existing “real” companies.

<td>- Virtual companies must be set up before data is stored in the tables. Retrofitting virtual companies onto an existing implementation is very difficult.<br><br>- Because there has been so much data normalization in the current version of Dynamics AX, it has become difficult to know what to add to the table collections. For example, it's difficult to know which tables to share. All the tables referenced from tables that are in a virtual company must also added. Because of table normalization, even simple master data that is spread across multiple tables must be part of the virtual company. Any mistake that is made here will cause functional issues.<br><br>- When a table is part of a virtual company, it loses information about the origin of the data, and only the virtual company is recorded.</td>
