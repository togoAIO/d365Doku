<h1 id="product-readiness">Product readiness</h1>


<p>You can use readiness checks to ensure that all the required master data has been specified for a product before it's used in transactions. When readiness checks are used, a user or team is made responsible for validating specific predefined product-related data. If there is an open readiness check for a product, the product can't be released or used in transactions.</p>
<p>The <strong>Active</strong> check box for an engineering product, variant, or version is available only after all the required data has been entered and verified, and after all the readiness checks have been processed. At that point, the product, version, or variant can be released to other companies and used in transactions. You can create readiness checks for new products, new variants, and new engineering versions.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-readiness-checks">Types of readiness checks</h2>
<p>There are three types of readiness checks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>System check</strong> – The system verifies whether there is a valid record. For example, the record might be an active bill of materials (BOM).</li>
<li><strong>Manual check</strong> – A user verifies whether the record is valid. For example, a readiness check might require validation of the default order settings. In some cases, such as when the product is still being designed and therefore won't be placed in stock, no default order settings are required. However, default order settings might be required for another product of the same type, because the product can be held in stock. The user is responsible for knowing how to correctly decision whether a readiness check is required.</li>
<li><strong>Checklist</strong> – The user answers a series of questions from a checklist, and the system determines whether the answers meet expectations. The checklist can have any subject. For example, it can be used to determine whether marketing materials or product documentation is completed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-readiness-checks-are-created-for-a-new-product-variant-or-version">How readiness checks are created for a new product, variant, or version</h2>
<p>When you create a new engineering <strong>product</strong>, the system determines whether a readiness check policy has been set up for the engineering product category. (Readiness check policies can be applied on the released product level, the released variant level, and the engineering version level.) If a policy has been set up, the following events occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Readiness checks are created for the product, according to the applicable policy.</li>
<li>The engineering version is set to inactive to block the product from being used. All the versions for the specific product that is involved are set to inactive.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a new <strong>variant</strong> is created for a product, the system checks whether readiness checks have been set up on the engineering product category. (Readiness checks can be applied on released variant level and the engineering version level.) If a readiness check has been set up, the following events occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Readiness checks are created for the product.</li>
<li>The engineering version is set to inactive to block the product from being used.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a new engineering <strong>version</strong> is created for a product, the system checks whether readiness checks have been set up on the engineering product category. (Readiness checks can be applied on the engineering version level.) If a readiness check has been set up, the following events occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Readiness checks are created for the product.</li>
<li>The engineering version is set to inactive to block the product from being used.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="view-readiness-checks">View readiness checks</h2>
<h3 id="view-open-readiness-checks-for-a-product-or-product-version">View open readiness checks for a product or product version</h3>
<p>To find the open readiness checks for a product, open the <strong>Released products details</strong> page. Then, on the Action Pane, on the <strong>Product</strong> tab, in the <strong>Readiness checks</strong> group, select <strong>Readiness checks</strong>.</p>
<p>To find the open readiness checks for a product version, open the <strong>Engineering versions</strong> page for a released product and choose a version. Then, on the Action Pane, on the <strong>Product</strong> tab, in the <strong>Checklist</strong> group, select <strong>Readiness checks</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="view-open-readiness-checks-that-are-assigned-to-you">View open readiness checks that are assigned to you</h3>
<p>To view the open readiness checks that are assigned to you, follow one of these steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <strong>Engineering change management &gt; Common &gt; Product readiness &gt; My open readiness checks</strong>.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Product information management &gt; Workspaces &gt; Product readiness for discrete manufacturing</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The setup that specifies who a readiness check is assigned to is done for the engineering product category. Readiness checks can be assigned to a person or a team. If a readiness check is assigned to a team, there is one person on the team who must process the readiness check. For more information, see <a href="engineering-versions-product-category.html">Engineering versions and engineering product categories</a>.</p>
<h2 id="process-open-readiness-checks">Process open readiness checks</h2>
<h3 id="process-system-and-manual-readiness-checks">Process system and manual readiness checks</h3>
<p>After you open the <strong>Readiness checks</strong> page, you can view the subject of system and manual readiness checks by selecting <strong>View related information</strong> on the Action Pane. You can then complete and/or validate the data for the readiness check. Open readiness checks have a <strong>Status</strong> value of <em>Pending</em>. This status indicates that the readiness check must still be processed. To process a readiness check, follow one of these steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the Action Pane, select <strong>Check/complete</strong> to review and complete the readiness check. When you've finished, the <strong>Status</strong> field is updated to <em>Passed</em>.</li>
<li>On the Action Pane, select <strong>Skip</strong> if you want to skip a readiness check that isn't mandatory. For example, you set up a readiness check for price calculations. However, you decide to skip this check while the product is still in the design phase. In this case, the <strong>Status</strong> field is updated to <em>Skipped</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the configuration of the readiness policy, when the <strong>Status</strong> field for a readiness check is updated to <em>Passed</em>, an extra step might be required to approve the readiness check. In this case, select <strong>Approval</strong> to complete the readiness check. This approval step is always mandatory when the readiness check is skipped.</p>
<p>When all the open readiness checks for a new product, variant, or version have been processed and approved as required, the item automatically becomes active and therefore ready to use.</p>
<h3 id="process-checklist-readiness-checks">Process checklist readiness checks</h3>
<p>To open a checklist, open the <strong>Readiness checks</strong> page, and then, on the Action Pane, select <strong>Start checklist</strong>. When you've completed the checklist, the system validates whether the readiness check is passed, based on the settings in the questionnaire. If the check is passed, the <strong>Status</strong> field is updated to <em>Passed</em>. If the readiness check isn't mandatory, you can skip it. In this case, the <strong>Status</strong> field is updated to <em>Skipped</em>.</p>
<p>Depending on the configuration of the readiness policy, when the <strong>Status</strong> field for a readiness check is updated to <em>Passed</em>, an extra step might be required to approve the readiness check. In this case, select <strong>Approval</strong> to complete the readiness check. This approval step is always mandatory when the readiness check is skipped.</p>
<p>When all the open readiness checks for a new product, variant, or version have been processed and approved as needed, the item automatically becomes active and therefore ready to use.</p>
<h2 id="create-and-manage-product-readiness-policies">Create and manage product readiness policies</h2>
<p>Use product readiness policies to manage the readiness checks that apply to a product. Because a readiness policy is assigned to the engineering category, all the checks in the readiness policy apply to all the engineering products that are based on the engineering category. For more information, see <a href="engineering-versions-product-category.html">Engineering versions and engineering product categories</a>.</p>
<p>Each readiness policy contains a set of readiness checks. When a readiness policy is assigned to an engineering product category, all the products that are created from that engineering product category will have the readiness checks that are indicated in the readiness policy.</p>
<p>To work with product readiness policies, go to <strong>Engineering change management &gt; Setup &gt; Product readiness policies</strong>. Then follow one of these steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>To create a new policy, select <strong>New</strong> on the Action Pane, and then set the fields as described in the following subsections.</li>
<li>To edit an existing policy, select it in the list pane, select <strong>Edit</strong> on the Action Pane, and then set the fields as described in the following subsections.</li>
<li>To delete an existing policy, select it in the list pane, select <strong>Edit</strong> on the Action Pane, and then, on the <strong>General</strong> FastTab, make sure that the <strong>Active</strong> option is set to <em>No</em>. Then select <strong>Delete</strong> on the Action Pane.</li>
