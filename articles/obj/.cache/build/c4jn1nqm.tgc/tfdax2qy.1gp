<p>In a centralized payment organization, there are many legal entities for operations, and each operating legal entity manages information for its own invoices. Payments for all the operating legal entities are generated from a single legal entity, which is sometimes referred to as the Treasury legal entity or Treasury company.</p>
<p>A Treasury company is responsible for monitoring the flow of cash and liquidity movement across companies and cash positions (shortage and surplus), and for preventing corporate cash shortage in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Here are the main goals of a Treasury company:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get an accurate liquidity/cash flow forecast, and do analysis for the medium-term/short-term horizon.</li>
<li>Manage payments daily by using payment schedule journals.</li>
<li>Control the company's cash position.</li>
<li>Maintain the company's cash flows through centralized control.</li>
</ul>
<p>This topic provides a step-by-step example that shows the settings and user activities for cash flow management.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The data set that is used in this topic is for demo purposes only. The codes that you use for ledger accounts, value-added tax (VAT), rates, and so on, should comply with the rules that are accepted in your company.</p>
</div>
<p>In this example, Contoso Retail RUS (RURT) is a subsidiary of an industrial holding company and does business as an operating legal entity. Contoso Entertainment Systems Russia (RUMF) is an internal bank of an industrial holding company and handles all payments.</p>
<p>The following table shows the stages of payment that a treasurer deals with during payment processing.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Business scenario</th>
<th>Payment cause</th>
<th>Payment stage</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>The company requests and confirms delivery of goods (that is, a purchase order that has a delivery schedule that is confirmed). A treasurer includes information about the expected payments (inflow or outflow) in the cash flow forecast by creating payment schedule journal of type "payment plan".
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Purchase order</li>
<li>Sales order</li>
<li>Free text invoice</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>Planned payment</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The company receives the payment request (prepayment request, invoice, and so on) from a seller. The manager creates a payment request, which should be approved by the manager lead and a treasurer. The treasurer includes information about the expected and approved payments (inflow or outflow) in the cash flow forecast.
<blockquote><strong>Important:</strong> The Payment request and the associated functionality are available only if the <strong>Payment request</strong> license configuration key is turned on.</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Vendor invoice</li>

<td>A treasurer generates and confirms the payment schedule journal (payment register). In this way, the company defines the list of payments that should be made by the bank/cash account.</td>

<p>After you complete the example that is provided in this topic, you will be able to perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure parameters for cash flow management to support the new functionality.</li>
<li>Process planned payments. Forecast transactions of incoming and outgoing payments are automatically created and updated based on purchase orders, sales orders, and free text invoices.</li>
<li>If the <strong>Payment request</strong> license configuration key is turned on, process payment requests based on indebtedness to vendors, customers, and workers, and prepayment requirements from vendors. (The processing includes the creation, update, and approval of payment requests.)</li>
<li>Process payment schedule journals for medium-term liquidity planning (payment plan) and daily payment management (payment register). Analyze cash deficit and surplus through payment schedule sheet balancing (the simulation function).</li>
<li>Generate payments, based on an approved payment register, which is a type of payment schedule journal.</li>
