<p>Recruiters and hiring managers can organize their candidates using the Talent pools functionality in Attract. Talent pools can help you keep track of and engage with all the candidates that apply for jobs at your company.</p>
<h2 id="create-and-share-a-talent-pool">Create and share a talent pool</h2>
<p>Any user who has the recruiter, hiring manager, or Attract administrator role can create talent pools. The owner of a talent pool can also share that pool with other users so that groups of users, especially recruiters, can look at a shared pool of candidates.</p>
<p>Contributors to a talent pool can view the list of candidates in that pool. They can also add candidates to the pool or remove candidates from it.</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to create and share a talent pool.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>On the Attract home page, in the left navigation pane, select <strong>Talent Pools</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>My talent pools</strong> tab shows all the talent pools that you have access to, with details about each. The details include the owner of the pool and the number of candidates in it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the upper-right of the page, select <strong>New</strong> to open the <strong>Create talent pool</strong> dialog box.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enter a unique name for the talent pool.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To add people as contributors to the pool, find their names by using the people picker, and then add them to the list. You can share a talent pool only with users who have the recruiter, hiring manager, or Attract administrator role.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Add</strong> to create the talent pool.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Alternatively, you can add contributors to a talent pool after you have created it. You can also manage access to a talent pool. For example, you can revoke a user's access to the talent pool.</p>
<ul>
<li>To add contributors to an existing talent pool that you own, on the <strong>My talent pools</strong> tab, in the upper right of the talent pool card, select the ellipsis button (<strong>…</strong>), and then select <strong>Edit</strong>. Find the people by using the people picker, and add them to the list.</li>
<li>To revoke a user's access to the talent pool, in the upper right of the talent pool card, select the ellipsis button (<strong>…</strong>), and then select <strong>Edit</strong>. On the <strong>Manage access</strong> tab, select the trash can button next to the user.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Update</strong> to complete and save the operation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>To create more than one talent pool, your organization must have the Comprehensive Hiring add-on.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="add-and-remove-candidates">Add and remove candidates</h2>
<p>The owner and contributors to the talent pool can add candidates to the talent pool, view the candidates in it, and remove candidates from it.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>On the <strong>My talent pools</strong> tab, select a talent pool to open it.</p>
<p>A list of the candidates who are part of the talent pool is shown.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To add candidates to the talent pool, select <strong>+ New</strong> in the upper right to open the <strong>Add candidate</strong> dialog box, and then do one of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To add an internal candidate, you can search for the person by email address. After a successful search, the candidate's email address, first name, and last name are filled in. If you have the candidate's resume or any related documents about the candidate, you can upload them at this point. Then select <strong>Add</strong> to add the candidate to the talent pool.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To add an external candidate, manually enter his or her email address, first name, and last name. If you have the candidate's resume or any related documents, you can upload them at this point. Then select <strong>Add</strong> to add the candidate to the talent pool.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To add multiple candidates, select the <strong>From Excel</strong> tab. You can then download the appropriate Microsoft Excel template, enter the details for the candidates, save the Excel worksheet, and upload it to the application.</p>
<p>If any errors are found in the worksheet, you will receive messages about them. You can then fix the errors and try to upload the worksheet again. When no more errors are found, select <strong>Add</strong> to upload the worksheet. The worksheet is processed in the background, and you'll be notified when all the candidates have been added to the talent pool.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>To remove an existing candidate from the talent pool, in the <strong>Action</strong> column, select the trash can button for that candidate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="search-and-view-candidate-profiles">Search and view candidate profiles</h2>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>This feature is currently in preview. If you want to try it, you must <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/talent/access-preview-feature">turn it on in the Attract admin settings</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Talent pools allow you to view a candidate's profile, LinkedIn information, related documents, and application history. You can search the entire database of all candidates added to any talent pool, including closed and active applicants.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>When you add new candidates or applicants, the new additions can take up to 15 minutes to be indexed for search.</p>
</div>
<p>With the improved search experience, you can search through all candidate documents and filter by silver medalists, sources, skills, education, and more. In previous versions, you had to specify the table you wanted to search through. Attract can now search all candidate-related columns and rank the results.</p>
<ol>
<li>To start a new search through the candidate database, enter the text that you want to search for in the search box on the <strong>Talent pools</strong> tab.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can type the candidate's name or any attributes that you're looking for. To separate attributes, use a space.</p>
<p>You can narrow your results either by changing your search query or by using the smart filters on the left side of the page.</p>
<p>The search results show highlights for the various attributes that matched your search query. Select any candidate that you're interested in to view their profile.</p>
