<h1 id="cost-control-workspace">Cost control workspace</h1>


<p>The <strong>Cost control</strong> workspace is a central point where managers who are responsible for controlling a cost object or a set of cost objects within a dimension or across dimensions (for example, cost centers and product groups) can access reports. The reports in the workspace are fully managed by cost accountants, so that the layout and data that are used for reporting can be consistent across the whole organization.</p>
<h2 id="cost-control-workspace-configuration">Cost control workspace configuration</h2>
<p>Cost accountants can define as many report configurations as they require for the desired data composition or layout. A report configuration consists of six sections, each of which contributes to either the selection of the targeted data composition or the layout.</p>
<p>To configure a cost control workspace, click <strong>Cost accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Cost control workspace configuration</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<p>On the <strong>General</strong> FastTab, you can create a unique report layout. The name of the report will be a unique identifier that users will be able to recognize in the <strong>Cost control</strong> workspace. You can also specify whether the report should be shared or kept internal for cost accountants.</p>

<p>The overhead calculation performs several calculation steps on the source data, such as cost behavior classification, cost distribution, and cost allocation. Multiple overhead calculations can be done for the same fiscal period, in case missing source data is discovered or rules must be updated. Each overhead calculation is saved with a unique ID. The cost accountant can select a specific overhead calculation ID. Users of the report, such as managers, will see the results of the overhead calculation in the <strong>Cost control</strong> workspace.</p>

<h2 id="cost-control-workspace-1">Cost control workspace</h2>
<p>The <strong>Cost control</strong> workspace is designed as a web report. Therefore, all managers who are responsible for a cost object can be granted access as described in <a href="access-rights-cost-object-controller.html">Define access rights for cost object controllers</a>.</p>
<p>The list of reports that are available for users, such as managers, is controlled by the setting of the <strong>Published</strong> option on the <strong>Cost control workspace configurations</strong> page.</p>
<p><img src="media/report-cost-control.png" alt="A report that users can see in the Cost control workspace"></p>
<p>A manager can select the fiscal calendar period to view. The session date is used to determine the default current period.</p>
<p>The values in the fiscal calendar period are determined by the report name and the fiscal calendar that is selected for the cost accounting ledger that is associated with the report name on the <strong>Cost control workspace configurations</strong> page.</p>
<p>In the cost object dimension hierarchy, users can select the aggregation level at which balances should be shown. By enabling access-level security, you control the permissions, so that users can select only the hierarchy levels that they have been granted access to. Therefore, they can see only the aggregated balances that they have been granted access to.</p>
<h3 id="add-or-remove-columns">Add or remove columns</h3>
<p>Users can customize the columns on a report to fit their requirements.</p>
<h3 id="view-details">View details</h3>
<p>Users can drill into the details behind the balances that are shown in the workspace. If users select a cost element dimension hierarchy node, and then click <strong>View details</strong>, the <strong>Cost element details</strong> dialog box shows detailed information for the node.</p>
<p>A grid shows each cost element that is associated with the cost element dimension hierarchy node, and its values. The columns that appear in the grid match the workspace settings.</p>
<p>Two charts show a summary of actual versus budget and budget variance by period.</p>
<p><img src="media/cost-element-details-operations.png" alt="Charts that show a summary of actual versus budget and budget variance by period"></p>
<p>Users can click <strong>Cost entries</strong> to drill down into the entry details as required.</p>
<p><img src="media/cost-entries.png" alt="Cost entries"></p>
<p>For example, rent is an expenditure that is distributed to cost centers. A user who wants to understand the rent cost that their cost center must carry can drill down to see how rent has been calculated.</p>
<p>If users click <strong>Allocation base</strong> on the <strong>Cost entries</strong> page, a dialog box appears. Users can then assign the allocation base to the rule and view the corresponding statistical measures that are registered for the period.</p>
<p>In the following example, the allocation base is of the <strong>Formula allocation base</strong> type, and the formula is shown. The factors that define the formula are listed. Additionally, a grid shows the calculation that is done per cost object.</p>
