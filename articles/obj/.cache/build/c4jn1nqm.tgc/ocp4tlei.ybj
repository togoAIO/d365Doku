<p>You should analyze the result from the Planning Optimization fit analysis as part of the migration process. Note that the scope of Planning Optimization is not equal to the current built-in master planning functionality. We recommend that you work with your partner and read the documentation to prepare for the migration.</p>
<p>Planning Optimization fit analysis helps you to identify where the result might differ between the built-in master planning engine and Planning Optimization. This analysis is done based on your current setup and data.</p>
<p>To see the Planning Optimization fit analysis result, go to <strong>Master planning</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Planning Optimization fit analysis</strong>, and then select <strong>Run analysis</strong>. If the analysis finds any inconsistencies, they are listed on the same page. (The analysis can take a few minutes to run.)</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>If inconsistencies are found, you can still use Planning Optimization. The results of the fit analysis just show places where the planning service won't honor your current setup. In other words, they show places where some processes might be ignored or might not be supported.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="analysis-results-example-1">Analysis results: Example 1</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature:</strong> Production</li>
<li><strong>Issue:</strong> Items with a bill of materials (BOM) level greater than zero: 56</li>
<li><strong>Explanation:</strong> The fit analysis found 56 items that have a BOM setup for production. Because the current version of Planning Optimization doesn't support production, Planning Optimization will generate planned purchase orders instead of planned production orders. It will also show a warning that lists the affected items.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analysis-results-example-2">Analysis results: Example 2</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature:</strong> Actions</li>
<li><strong>Issue:</strong> Coverage groups with actions calculation enabled: 6</li>
<li><strong>Explanation:</strong> The fit analysis found six coverage groups where action calculation is turned on. Because the current version of Planning Optimization doesn't support actions, no actions will be generated during master planning.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following table shows the various results that can be shown after a fit analysis. Number signs (<em>#</em>) will be replaced with a number that indicates the number of records that have the listed issue. Supported or in-preview features are available with version 10.0.9 or later (unless a higher version number is listed in the &quot;Expected availability&quot; column).</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Actions</td>
<td>Coverage groups with Actions calculation enabled: <em>#</em></td>
<td>This feature is pending. Currently, actions aren't generated during master planning when Planning Optimization is enabled, regardless of this setting. The main purpose of actions is to suggest changes to existing orders. Evaluate if actions are actively applied as part of your business processes or if the delay information related to the orders is sufficient.</td>

<td>Base calendars</td>
<td>Calendars using base calendar: <em>#</em></td>
<td>This feature is pending. Currently, the base calendar is ignored when Planning Optimization is enabled. Evaluate if the base calendar is needed for your business processes or if direct setup in calendars is sufficient.</td>

<tr>
<td>Copy static to dynamic plan</td>
<td>Copy of static to dynamic plan is enabled on the master planning parameters.</td>
<td>Planning Optimization doesn't copy the static plan to the dynamic plan, regardless of this setting. In general, this concept is less relevant because of the speed and complete regeneration that Planning Optimization provides. If two or more plans are used, master planning should be triggered for each plan.</td>

<td>Firming</td>
<td>Coverage groups with auto firming time fence set: <em>#</em></td>
<td>In version 10.0.7 and later, firming is supported as a separate firming batch job after master planning is completed (provided the <em>Auto-firming for Planning Optimization</em> feature has been enabled in <a href="../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.html">feature management</a>). Note that auto firming for Planning Optimization is based on the order date (start date), not the requirement date (end date).

<td>Safety stock fulfillment</td>
<td>Item coverage records with &quot;Fulfill minimum&quot; different from &quot;Today's date + procurement time&quot;: <em>#</em></td>
<td>Planning Optimization always uses <em>Today's date + procurement time</em>. This change is made to prepare for a simplified planning setup in the future, and to provide an actionable result. If the procurement time isn't included for safety stock, planned orders that are created for current low on-hand inventory will always be delayed because of the lead time. This behavior can cause significant noise and unwanted planned orders. The best practice is to change the setting so that <em>Today's date + procurement time</em> is used. Update master data to avoid warnings.</td>
