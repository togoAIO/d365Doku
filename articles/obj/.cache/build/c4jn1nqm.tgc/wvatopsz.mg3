<p sourcefile="finance/localizations/e-invoicing-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="37">Electronic invoicing add-on feature setup is the process of creating the required configuration through the Regulatory Configuration Services (RCS) environment and publishing that configuration to the Electronic invoicing add-on server. The setup lets you create the configurable rules that enable the Electronic invoicing add-on to use a secure protocol over the internet to communicate and exchange data with a third-party entity through web services.</p>
<p sourcefile="finance/localizations/e-invoicing-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">The configurability relies on the Electronic reporting (ER) format configuration as a means to build content that is sent and received through digital files. It also relies on the orchestration of communication actions to send requests to and receive responses from third-party web services without requiring that you write code.</p>
<h2 id="overview" sourcefile="finance/localizations/e-invoicing-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">Overview</h2>
<p sourcefile="finance/localizations/e-invoicing-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="43">&quot;The Electronic invoicing add-on feature&quot; is the generic name for the resource that is configured and published to consume the Electronic invoicing add-on server. The feature setup combines, among other things, the use of ER configuration formats to create configurable export and import files, and the use of actions and actions flows to enable the creation of configurable rules to send requests, import responses, and parse the response contents.</p>
<p sourcefile="finance/localizations/e-invoicing-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="45">The following illustration shows the main components of an Electronic invoicing add-on feature.</p>

<p sourcefile="finance/localizations/e-invoicing-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="49">Because of variations in invoice formats and action flows, the feature setup might vary according to country or region, or according to business requirements.</p>
