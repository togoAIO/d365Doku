<h1 id="generate-aca-reports-in-benefits-management">Generate ACA reports in Benefits management</h1>

<p>Benefits management helps you track information that is reported on Form 1095-B and Form 1095-C for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) employer mandate. Like the ACA reporting capability in the old <strong>Benefits</strong> workspace, this functionality applies only to legal entities in the United States.</p>
<p>To use this functionality, you must first turn on <strong>Advanced Benefits Management</strong>. For more information, including important caveats about Benefits management, see <a href="hr-admin-manage-features.html#enable-or-disable-benefits-management">Enable or disable Benefits management</a>.</p>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>You can use ACA reporting only from either the <strong>Benefits management</strong> workspace or the old <strong>Benefits</strong> workspace, not from both. For example, if you switched to Benefits management, ACA reporting is available only from the <strong>Benefits management</strong> workspace, not from the old <strong>Benefits</strong> workspace.</p>
<p>If you switch to Benefits management in the middle of an enrollment year, you must correctly configure employee data for the whole year in Benefits management. In this way, you ensure that you will receive accurate reporting information for the whole year.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>To track information for 1095 forms, first create one or more Affordable Care coverage groups. These groups indicate the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The offer of coverage that was provided to an employee</li>
<li>The employee's share of the lowest-cost monthly premium, if the cost is above the federal poverty line</li>
<li>The safe harbor that is used by the employer, if applicable</li>
</ul>
<p>Affordable Care coverage groups help you manage this information for multiple employee records that have the same conditions. You can easily assign groups to one or more employees.</p>
<h3 id="create-or-edit-an-affordable-care-coverage-group">Create or edit an Affordable Care coverage group</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>In the <strong>Benefits management</strong> workspace, select <strong>Affordable Care coverage group</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="media/hr-benefits-management-aca-coverage-group.png" alt="Selecting Affordable Care coverage group"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>New</strong> to create a new Affordable Care coverage group or <strong>Edit</strong> to change an existing group.</p>
<p><img src="media/hr-benefits-management-aca-new.png" alt="Selecting New or Edit"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Set the following fields.</p>
<table>

<h3 id="assign-multiple-employees-to-an-affordable-care-coverage-group">Assign multiple employees to an Affordable Care coverage group</h3>

</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="maintain-multiple-versions-of-coverage-options">Maintain multiple versions of coverage options</h2>
<p>You can maintain multiple versions of any coverage group. When something changes in your organization or the benefits that are offered, you can keep the group's information up to date without having to create a new group and reassign employees to it.</p>
<p>After you've created Affordable Care coverage groups, you can mass-assign employees to them. You can also individually assign employees to groups, and indicate whether ACA information is tracked and reported.</p>
<p>If you don't have to track and report ACA information for an employee, you can set the <strong>Report coverage</strong> option to <strong>No</strong>. For example, you might have part-time employees who don't require ACA reporting.</p>
<h3 id="override-default-values-for-an-employee">Override default values for an employee</h3>
<p>For employees who are assigned to an Affordable Care coverage group, you can change the following options for any months that require different values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offer of coverage</li>
<li>Employee share of cost</li>
<li>Applicable section 4980H safe harbor</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>For 2020 ACA reports, you must report both work and home ZIP Codes on Form 1095-C. Values are automatically filled in, based on current active locations. If either location was different during any part of the year, you must override the value. The <strong>ZIP Code</strong> field (line 17) of the 1095-C report is filled in only if the <strong>Offer of coverage</strong> code contains <strong>1L</strong> through <strong>1Q</strong>, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1L, 1M, or 1N:</strong> The primary residence ZIP Code</li>
<li><strong>1O, 1P, 1Q:</strong> The primary work ZIP Code</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>To enter exceptions for any values of an Affordable Care coverage group, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the <strong>Personnel management</strong> workspace, select <strong>Links</strong>, and then select <strong>Workers</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the employee in the list.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Employment</strong> tab, in the <strong>More information</strong> section, select <strong>Affordable Care coverage</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="media/hr-benefits-management-aca-change-single-employee.png" alt="Changing options for one employee"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Edit</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For each month that requires changes, select the <strong>Override default</strong> check box, and then change the other values as required.</p>
<p><img src="media/hr-benefits-management-aca-override-default.png" alt="Overriding default values"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="report-health-care-coverage">Report health care coverage</h2>
<p>You must track any employer-sponsored, self-insured health care coverage for full-time and part-time employees. Include each employee, together with their dependents, on the 1095-C report for the months when they were covered.</p>
<p>To indicate whether a benefit plan must be reported, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the <strong>Benefits management</strong> workspace, select <strong>Benefit plans</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the benefit plan to report.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Edit</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Set the <strong>Reported under the Affordable Care Act</strong> option to <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="media/hr-benefits-management-aca-report-coverage.png" alt="Reporting health care coverage"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If an employee chooses health care coverage for a dependent, the dependent's coverage period is determined by the date when the dependent was enrolled or removed. Coverage dates for dependents are automatically calculated based on the period when the dependent was eligible and active in a plan during the enrollment year.</p>
<h2 id="generate-1095-b-and-1095-c-forms">Generate 1095-B and 1095-C forms</h2>
<p>You can generate ACA 1095-B and 1095-C forms, and then distribute them to each of your employees. You can also electronically generate Form 1095-C and the corresponding 1094-C transmittal files to send to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the <strong>Benefits management</strong> workspace, select <strong>ACA 1095-B form</strong> or <strong>ACA 1095-C form</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the parameters as required, and then select <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
