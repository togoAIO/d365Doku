<p>Dynamics 365 Finance has evolved into purpose-built applications to help you manage specific business functions. For more information about these changes, see <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544">Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide</a>.</p>
<p>This topic describes the standard reports that are provided to help you with the INTERVAT tax declaration and reconciliation analysis.</p>
<p>Based on the sales tax entries for selected periods, the Belgian periodic value-added tax (VAT) declaration combines sales tax amounts into boxes (sales tax reporting codes) by sorting, splitting, and totaling information in specific ways. Therefore, control reports are required, so that the amounts in the VAT declaration can be verified in detail. The rest of this topic describes the reports that include details of the data in the VAT declaration.</p>
<p>Screenshots presented in this topic show data based on transactions from an example in the topic, <a href="emea-bel-intervat-tax-declaration.html">INTERVAT tax declaration</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sales-tax-correction">Sales tax correction</h2>

(Sales tax boxes are Belgium-specific fields that are used to group VAT sales tax amounts in the VAT declaration. You set up these boxes in the <strong>Sales tax reporting codes</strong> table.)</p>
<p>To print the <strong>Sales tax correction</strong> report, go to <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Declarations</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Additional sales tax report boxes</strong>, and then click <strong>Tax corrections</strong> &gt; <strong>Print.</strong></p>
