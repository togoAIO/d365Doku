<p sourcefile="finance/localizations/emea-invoice-issue-deadline.md" sourcestartlinenumber="35">This article explains how to set up parameters to calculate the due dates for issuing customer invoices and vendor invoices in the European Union (EU).</p>
<p sourcefile="finance/localizations/emea-invoice-issue-deadline.md" sourcestartlinenumber="37">European Union (EU) Directive 45/2010 and other directives require that shipments within the EU (intra-EU shipments) must be invoiced on or before the fifteenth day of the month after the delivery is made. At the same time, each EU country can have different invoicing deadlines for domestic deliveries. Invoice issue due date functionality lets you align the date interval to the country/region type. Then, for all shipments to and from a country/region of a particular type, the invoice issue due date is calculated by using rules that are set in the specified date interval. In addition, you can get all packing slips that have a specific invoice issue due date, filter by invoice issue due date during periodic sales invoicing, and control the sales invoice issue date during invoice posting. You can set up a date interval code, and then set up a calculation rule for the invoice issue date by assigning the date interval code to a country/region type. The calculation rule is used to calculate the due date for issuing invoices for the following transactions:</p>
<ul sourcefile="finance/localizations/emea-invoice-issue-deadline.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">
<li sourcefile="finance/localizations/emea-invoice-issue-deadline.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">Intra-EU shipments</li>
<li sourcefile="finance/localizations/emea-invoice-issue-deadline.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">Domestic shipments within an EU member state</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="finance/localizations/emea-invoice-issue-deadline.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">You can also set up date controls to help guarantee that customer invoices and credit notes for customer transactions are generated within the specified period after the delivery is made.</p>
