<p sourcefile="talent/attract-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="35">Attract provides capabilities for managing the process of hiring new talent. Candidates can be added to open jobs, and they can then be advanced from stage to stage until either an offer is extended or the application is rejected. During each stage, candidates move through activities such as screening calls, assessments, and interviews. After they apply, candidates receive an email that invites them to sign in to Attract, where they can follow the status of the job and their application. They can also respond to any tasks that are assigned to them.</p>

<p sourcefile="talent/attract-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="46">Candidates can be added to a job individually, or they can be uploaded in larger numbers from an Excel spreadsheet. All candidates are automatically added to the Apply stage, which is the first stage in the hiring process for every job. During this stage, all a candidate's application information can be viewed and managed. Additional documents can be uploaded and viewed, together with contact information such as email addresses, phone numbers, and links to social media accounts. If a candidate provided a link to his or her LinkedIn profile, and if LinkedIn integration has been set up, the candidate's profile is shown. (LinkedIn integration requires a LinkedIn recruiter license.)</p>
<h2 id="stages" sourcefile="talent/attract-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="48">Stages</h2>
<p sourcefile="talent/attract-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="49">Attract provides a predefined hiring process that has four basic stages: Apply, Screen, Interview, and Offer. New candidates start in the Apply stage, where their resume, cover letter, portfolio, and other application documents are reviewed. From there, candidates can be advanced to the Screen stage, where they are invited to participate in a screening phone call or a Skype video interview. The hiring manager and recruiter can provide feedback about candidates and advance them to the next stage, which is the Interview stage. In-person interviews are then scheduled with available members of the hiring team. These interviews can be customized as one-on-one or panel interviews of various lengths. After the interviews, feedback from the interview team is captured and reviewed. Selected candidates are then advanced to the final stage, the Offer stage. During this stage, an offer is made and prepared for the candidate's review and approval.</p>
