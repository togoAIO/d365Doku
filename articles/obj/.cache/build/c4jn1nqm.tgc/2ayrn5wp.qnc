<p>This topic describes the process for enrolling workers in garnishments, tax levies, and any associated administrative fees. Garnishments and tax levies are managed by using the benefit framework. This framework helps ensure that the payroll impact of garnishments and tax levies is handled correctly.</p>
<p>If you have questions about garnishments and tax levies that aren't answered in this topic, or in the <a href="noam-usa-garnishment-tax-levy-set-up-tasks.html">Set up garnishments and tax levies</a> or <a href="noam-usa-garnishment-tax-levy-administrative-fees.html">Garnishments, tax levies, and administrative fees FAQ</a> topics, contact your legal advisors. To learn more about the concepts that are discussed in this topic, see <a href="noam-usa-garnishment-tax-levy-administrative-fees.html">Garnishments, tax levies, and administrative fees FAQ</a>.</p>
<h2 id="enroll-a-worker-in-a-garnishment-or-tax-levy">Enroll a worker in a garnishment or tax levy</h2>
<p>When the Payroll department is notified about a court-ordered garnishment or tax levy, the federal government requires that deductions begin within a specific number of days. As for other garnishment rules, some states might use federal rules, or they might set their own requirements. For example, a state might require that deductions begin in the first payroll payment, no later than three days after the court order is received. Because this payment might occur in the current pay period, it's in your interest to enroll workers as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>When you enroll a worker, you set up payroll information, together with details of the garnishment or tax levy.</p>
<p>During the enrollment process, you will be prompted for various information.</p>
<p>Start on the <strong>Payroll details</strong> FastTab. The following table shows the information that you must enter.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Benefit</td>
<td>Enter <strong>Eligibility passed</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Paid by</td>
<td>Specify the legal entity that the worker is employed by, and that pays for the worker position. By default, the current legal entity is shown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Position</td>
<td>If you select a position, the deduction for the garnishment is based only on the earnings from that position. It's unlikely that a garnishment will be based on earnings from a specific position. If you don't select a position, the deductions for the garnishment are based on all the worker's earnings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vendor</td>
<td>Specify the vendor that the garnishment is paid to. Typically, this vendor is a state agency and is listed on the garnishment order. If you don't already have a vendor record for the agency, you must create it. For more information, see <a href="../../../../supply-chain/procurement/tasks/create-vendor-account.html">Create a vendor account</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Calculation priority</td>
<td>The number that you enter determines the order that deductions for the garnishment are calculated in, relative to other benefits. The deductions and contributions for the benefit that has the lowest calculation priority number are calculated first. The lowest calculation priority number is 0 (zero). The calculation priority is important when the result of the calculation for one benefit is used in the calculation for another benefit. For example, in some states, the deductions for union dues and health plans reduce disposable income. To make sure that the garnishment is calculated correctly, you must make sure that union dues and health plans have a lower calculation priority number than the garnishment has. For tax levies, voluntary benefit enrollments that were in place before the tax levy typically have higher priority than the tax levy. Therefore, those benefits must have a lower calculation priority number than the tax levy.<blockquote>[!NOTE] Your legal advisors should help you determine the correct calculation priority for all benefits.</blockquote></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Deduction priority</td>
<td>The number that you enter determines the order that deductions for the garnishment are made in, relative to other deductions. The deduction for the benefit that has the lowest deduction priority number is made first. The lowest deduction priority number is 0 (zero). Often, garnishments must be deducted from pay before other voluntary benefits. However, some states require that specific deductions take precedence, such as union dues or term life deductions. The default value for this field is set on the <strong>Benefit elements</strong> page.<blockquote>[!NOTE] Your legal advisors should help you determine the correct deduction priority for all benefits.</blockquote></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rate source</td>
<td>This field is automatically set to <strong>Custom</strong>. Because you must manually maintain the amount of a garnishment, you can't change this value. For more information, see &quot;Setting up payroll information for benefits&quot; in <a href="noam-usa-worker-position-payroll-tasks.html">Set up payroll for workers</a>. This field isn't available for tax levies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Basis Deduction</td>
<td>The court order indicates whether the deduction should be a fixed amount (for example, 350.00 per pay period) or a percentage of earnings (for example, 15 percent of earnings). Select the basis, and then enter the deduction amount that is specified on the court order. These fields aren't available for tax levies. The tax levy deduction is calculated based on the information on the <strong>Tax levy details</strong> FastTab.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Notes</td>
<td>Enter detailed information about the garnishment order, such as the date when it was received, data that was entered, and communication with the worker.</td>
</tr>

<td>Select the method to use if the amount of the deduction must be split among multiple garnishments of the same type:
<ul>
<li><strong>None</strong> – The garnishment should not be included in a group of garnishments.</li>
<li><strong>Pro rata</strong> – The deduction is divided so that each garnishment receives a proportionate amount.</li>
<li><strong>Equal</strong> – The deduction is divided so that each garnishment receives an equal amount.</li>
<li><strong>First in</strong> – The garnishments are satisfied in the order in which the worker enrolled in them. This option is typically used for tax levies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>[!IMPORTANT] If the court order doesn't specify which method to use, check with your legal advisors for clarification. Typically, if the orders have the same type but are from different states, the laws in the state where the worker works apply. For example, a worker who is located in Washington has three orders: two from California and one from Idaho. The rules for Washington apply to all three orders. However, if this worker has two support orders from California and a creditor garnishment from Idaho, the support orders use the California rules, and the creditor garnishment uses the Idaho rules. If it isn't clear which method you should use, check with your legal advisors.</blockquote></td>

<p>This section applies only if the garnishment enhancement hotfix isn't installed. When a worker has more than one garnishment order or tax levy, you might not be able to deduct the full amount of every garnishment and tax levy. Federal and state laws dictate the maximum combined amount that can be deducted for all garnishments, tax levies, and administrative fees.</p>
<p>State laws dictate how the total amount should be allocated among the various garnishments and tax levies. This allocation is partly based on the garnishment type and the calculation priority. When a worker's garnishments have the same type and calculation priority, the amounts are calculated automatically. If a worker has more than one type of garnishment, you might have to do some of the calculations manually. Procedures for both situations are described later in this topic.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-multiple-garnishments-of-the-same-type">Setting up multiple garnishments of the same type</h3>
<p>When a worker has more than one garnishment of the same type and the same calculation priority, you must specify the multiple garnishment method that is used to allocate the amount of the deduction among the garnishments, as described in &quot;Enrolling a worker in a garnishment or tax levy,&quot; earlier in this topic. When multiple garnishments must be processed together, make sure that the garnishments have the same values in the following fields on the <strong>Maintain benefits</strong> page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculation priority</li>
<li>Garnishment type</li>
<li>Multiple garnishment method</li>
</ul>
<p>Any garnishment that has a different value in one of these fields isn't included with the garnishments that are processed together. To make sure that garnishments of the same type are calculated correctly, you might have to adjust the calculation priority on one or more of the garnishments, so that the priorities match. You should seek guidance from your legal advisors any time that a worker has more than one garnishment or tax levy of the same type.</p>
<h3 id="example-of-multiple-garnishments-of-the-same-type">Example of multiple garnishments of the same type</h3>
<p>A worker has the following three child support orders. Because the calculation priority, garnishment type, and multiple garnishment method of all three child support orders match, the three garnishments are processed together.</p>

<p>The worker's gross wages for the pay period are 2,000.00, and the total amount of taxes and benefits that are excluded from the worker's disposable income is 600.00. Therefore, the worker's calculated disposable income is 2,000.00 – 600.00, or 1,400.00.</p>
<p>The maximum amount that can be withheld from the worker's pay for these garnishments is 55 percent of 1,400.00, or 770.00.</p>
<p>The total amount that is required by the three garnishments is 450.00 + 225.00 + 200.00, or 875.00.</p>
<p>Because 875.00 is more than 770.00, which is the maximum withholding amount that is allowed, the multiple garnishment method must be applied.</p>
<div class="NOTE">

<li>Maximum withholding amount that is allowed: 770.00</li>
<li>Percentage that can be applied to the first order: 51 percent (450.00 ÷ 875.00)</li>
<li>Percentage that can be applied to the second order: 26 percent (250.00 ÷ 875.00)</li>
<li>Percentage that can be applied to the third order: 23 percent (200.00 ÷ 875.00)</li>
<li>First garnishment amount: 392.00 (770.00 × 0.51)</li>
<li>Second garnishment amount: 200.20 (770.00 × 0.26)</li>
<li>Third garnishment amount: 177.10 (770.00 × 0.23)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-the-amount-is-calculated-when-the-equal-method-is-used">How the amount is calculated when the Equal method is used</h4>
<p>Based on the wages and other factors that are described in the previous section, here are the garnishment amounts for the <strong>Equal</strong> method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum withholding amount that is allowed: 770.00</li>
<li>Maximum withholding amount divided by 3, because there are three orders: 256.67</li>
<li>Third garnishment amount: 200.00 (the smaller of 256.67 and the requested amount)</li>
<li>Second garnishment amount: 225.00 (the smaller of 256.67 and the requested amount)</li>
<li>First garnishment amount: 345.00 (the maximum amount of 770.00 after it has been reduced by 200.00 from Gam03 and by 225.00 from Gam02)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-the-amount-is-determined-when-the-first-in-method-is-used">How the amount is determined when the First-in method is used</h4>
<p>Based on the wages and other factors that were described earlier, here are the garnishment amounts for the <strong>First-in</strong> method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum withholding amount that is allowed: 770.00.</li>
<li>First garnishment amount: 450.00. This garnishment is satisfied in full and is then subtracted from the maximum amount. Therefore, 320.00 remains for the other two garnishments.</li>
<li>Second garnishment amount: 225.00. This garnishment is satisfied in full and is then subtracted from the remaining 320.00. Therefore, 95.00 remains for the third garnishment.</li>
<li>Third garnishment amount: 95.00</li>
</ul>
<p>After the amount remains reaches 0 (zero), no additional amounts can be deducted for any garnishment.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-multiple-garnishments-of-different-types">Setting up multiple garnishments of different types</h2>
<p>When a worker has multiple garnishments of different types, the individual limit that applies to each garnishment can be determined automatically. However, the final deductions against a single limit for the combined total of all the garnishments can't be determined. Therefore, when there are multiple garnishments of different types, you must manually calculate the total disposable income limit, and you must determine whether the combined amount of all the garnishments and tax levies exceeds the maximum deduction limit.</p>
<p>If the combined amount exceeds the maximum deduction limit, set the following values on the <strong>Maintain benefits</strong> page for each garnishment and tax levy that the worker is enrolled in.</p>
