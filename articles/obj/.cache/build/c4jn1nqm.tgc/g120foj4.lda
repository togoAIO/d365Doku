<h1 id="set-up-benefits">Set up benefits</h1>


<p>This topic describes how to set up current and future benefits that workers and their dependents and beneficiaries can receive, and how to maintain payroll information for benefits. Examples of benefits include medical insurance, retirement investments, workers' compensation plans, and parking benefits.</p>
<p>Garnishments and tax levies are also set up as benefits, but the steps for setting them up differ. For more information, see <a href="noam-usa-garnishment-tax-levy-set-up-tasks.html">Set up garnishments and tax levies</a>. After you set up benefit elements by using the <strong>Benefit elements</strong> page, you must create the benefits so that they can be assigned to workers. When you create a benefit, you link an option to a benefit plan, designate a benefit period, and assign eligibility rules to the benefit.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-benefit-elements">Setting up benefit elements</h2>
<p>A benefit is a combination of the benefit type, plan, and option:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type</strong> – A collection or category that includes plans for a specific benefit, such as health insurance or parking.</li>
<li><strong>Plan</strong> – A specific benefit that is contracted from a provider.</li>
<li><strong>Option</strong> – The coverage level, such as employee only, or employee and spouse.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="setting-up-benefit-types">Setting up benefit types</h3>
<p>To set up benefits, you must first set up benefit types. On the <strong>Benefit elements</strong> page, in the <strong>Types</strong> area, click <strong>New</strong> to create a benefit type. Then enter the following information.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Type Description</td>
<td>Enter a name and a brief description for the benefit type.</td>

<tr>
<td>Concurrent enrollment</td>
<td>Select one of the following concurrent enrollment options:
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple enrollments per type</strong> – You can enroll a worker in multiple plans that have the same benefit type, even if the enrollment is effective for the same period. For example, a worker can be enrolled in two term life insurance plans.</li>
<li><strong>One enrollment per type</strong> – You can't enroll a worker in more than one plan that has the same benefit type for the same period. For example, if the worker already has health insurance for a specified period, you can't enroll the worker in another health insurance plan that covers the same period.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Payroll category</td>
<td>Select a payroll category to use for benefits that have the new benefit type. The payroll category determines the settings that are available for a selected plan in the <strong>Plans</strong> area of this page. Settings that don't apply to the payroll category aren't available.</td>

<td>Payroll impact</td>
<td>Select one of these options:
<ul>
<li><strong>None</strong> – No amounts are contributed by the employer or deducted from the worker's pay. When you select this option, the FastTabs on this page aren't available. Note that when the payroll category for the benefit type is <strong>None</strong>, the payroll impact is also <strong>None</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Deduction only</strong> – An amount is deducted from the worker's pay for this benefit, but no employer contribution is made. When you select this option, controls that are related to payroll deductions are available on the other FastTabs, but controls that are related to employer contributions aren't available.</li>
<li><strong>Contribution only</strong> – An employer contribution is made for this benefit, but no amount is deducted from the worker's pay. When you select this option, controls that are related to employer contributions are available on the other FastTabs, but controls that are related to payroll deductions aren't available.</li>
<li><strong>Deduction and contribution</strong> – An employer contribution is made for this benefit, and an additional amount is deducted from the worker's pay. When you select this option, controls that are related to both employer contributions and payroll deductions are available on the other FastTabs.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Next, you must select the pretax basis for the plan on the <strong>Tax rule</strong> FastTab. The pretax basis determines the pattern of before-tax and after-tax treatment for payroll deductions and employer contributions. In the rare event that no preset options are available for your plan, select <strong>Custom</strong>, and then select a custom pretax method to specify the taxes that should not be deducted from the paychecks of employees who enroll in the plan.</p>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>Select <strong>Custom</strong> only when no preset patterns are appropriate. If you must use <strong>Custom</strong>, work with your legal advisors to verify that the settings for the benefit plan are correct.

<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>To create retirement benefits, you must first set up the contribution calculation rate tables. If you haven't yet set up the rate tables, continue with the &quot;Setting up contribution calculation rates for retirement benefits&quot; section and then the &quot;Creating a new benefit&quot; section, later in this topic.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="setting-up-contribution-calculation-rates-for-retirement-benefits">Setting up contribution calculation rates for retirement benefits</h2>
<p>For retirement benefits, the method that is used to determine the employee contribution rate and the employer contribution rate is determined by the rate table that you define on the <strong>Contribution calculation rates</strong> page and then assign to the benefit on the <strong>Benefits</strong> page. Before you start this task, we recommend that you create a list of your retirement plans. For each plan, include the contribution method, employee deductions, and employer contributions.</p>
<h3 id="example-that-involves-two-retirement-plans">Example that involves two retirement plans</h3>
<p>Your organization offers two retirement plans:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan 1</strong> – Your organization matches the worker's contributions to the plan at a rate of 50 percent up to the first 3 percent, and then at a rate of 100 percent up to 6 percent.</li>
<li><strong>Plan 2</strong> – Your organization contributes 1 percent of the worker's pay to the 401(k) plan when the worker's contributions are between 1 percent and 3 percent of his or her pay. It contributes 2 percent when the worker's contributions are between 3 percent and 6 percent. Finally, it contributes 3 percent when the worker's contributions are 6 percent or more.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this example, the rate table looks like this.</p>
<table>

<p>Two tier types are available on the <strong>Contribution calculation rates</strong> page.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single line</strong> – If you select this tier type, only one line from the rate table is used to calculate the amount of the employer's contribution. For example, if the worker's deduction rate is 10 percent of his or her $1,000.00 earnings, the employer's contribution for plan 1 is 0.00. For plan 2, the employer's contribution is 30.00 for the same worker.</li>
<li><strong>Cascading tier</strong> – If you select this tier type, multiple lines from the rate table are used to calculate the amount of the employer's contribution. Only lines that have a deduction rate that is less than or equal to the actual worker deduction rate are used to calculate the employer contribution amount. For example, if the worker's deduction rate is 10 percent of his or her $1,000.00 earnings, the employer's contribution for plan 1 is 45.00. For plan 2, the employer's contribution is 60.00 for the same worker.</li>

In this case, the amount of the employer's contribution is 0.02, or 2 percent of the employee's earnings. For this option, the worker deduction amount and the employer contribution amount are calculated separately.</li>
<li><strong>Percent of employee</strong> – The employer's contribution is calculated by multiplying the employer contribution rate by the worker deduction rate. For example, the worker deduction rate is 0.03, and the employer contribution rate is 0.5.
