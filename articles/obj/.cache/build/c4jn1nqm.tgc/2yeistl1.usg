<p>Export sales are taxable at a value-added tax (VAT) rate of 0 (zero) percent. However, taxpayers can apply this tax rate only after they receive confirmation from the tax authority within a specified period. Taxpayers must collect the necessary documents to confirm their right to apply VAT at a rate of 0 percent for export sales within this period.</p>
<p>If the tax authority provides the confirmation within the specified period, the tax is calculated at a VAT rate of 0 percent, and a facture for confirmed export at the 0-percent rate is included in the sales book. If the confirmation isn't received in time, the taxpayer must pay tax at the standard VAT rate or reduced VAT rate that is applicable in the domestic market, together with any tax that is overdue from the export confirmation. Export factures for both confirmed export and unconfirmed export are included in the sales book.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The following features are available for export sales processing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Creating factures for export sales</p>
</li>
<li><p>Processing factures to determine the VAT tax base:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preliminary processing of export factures</li>
<li>Outgoing VAT processing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Creating corrective factures to charge the VAT on unconfirmed export during the preliminary facture processing</p>
</li>
<li><p>Including export factures in the sales book during the outgoing VAT processing that is based on the results of the preliminary facture processing</p>
</li>
<li><p>Calculating fines for overdue tax payments</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="number-sequences-for-export-factures-and-vat-processing">Number sequences for export factures and VAT processing</h2>
<p>After export factures are processed on the <strong>Outgoing VAT processing</strong> page, they are reflected in the sales book in a deferred mode. Therefore, you must set up number sequences for the following documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Export factures</li>
<li>The ledger documents that are used to post taxes on the <strong>Outgoing VAT processing</strong> page</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="#numbersequencesexport">Set up number sequences for export factures and VAT processing</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="customer-as-a-foreign-counteragent">Customer as a foreign counteragent</h2>
<p>To receive items that must be exported, a customer must be set up as a foreign counteragent. The customer must be set up as a foreign counteragent before you can create a customs journal for the export operation.</p>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="#foreigncounteragent">Set up a customer as a foreign counteragent</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="facture-for-export-sales">Facture for export sales</h2>
<p>A facture is an <em>export facture</em> if it's created based on invoices that contain sales tax codes where the <strong>Type of tax</strong> field is set to <strong>VAT 0%</strong>. The tax code for the domestic market must be set up for these codes. For more information, see the <a href="#salestaxcodeexporttrade">Set up a sales tax code for export trade</a> section.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>All the invoices that are included in a facture must have the same type of VAT.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Accounts receivable</strong> &gt; <strong>Inquiries and reports</strong> &gt; <strong>Facture</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Facture journal</strong> page, on the <strong>Foreign trade</strong> tab, in the <strong>Export date</strong> field, select the date when items were exported under customs export conditions. In other words, select the date when the customs authority allowed items to be exported. The deadline for collecting the documents to confirm your right to apply VAT at a rate of 0 percent is calculated from this date.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Package date</strong> field, select the date when the full package of documents that confirm your right to apply VAT at a rate of 0 percent is collected.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Confirmation date</strong> field, select the date when the tax authority confirmed VAT at a rate of 0 percent.</p>
<p>The <strong>Expiration date</strong> field shows the expiration date of the period for collecting the document package that confirms your right to apply VAT at a rate of 0 percent. If the tax authority doesn't confirm this right before the expiration date, the taxpayer is obligated to calculate VAT by using the rate from the tax code for the domestic market. For more information, see the <a href="#salestaxcodeexporttrade">Set up a sales tax code for export trade</a> section.</p>
<p>The expiration date is automatically calculated. For more information, see the <a href="#documentcollectionperiod">Set up a document collection period and confirm the application of VAT at 0 percent</a> section.</p>
<p>If the <strong>Into processing</strong> option is set to <strong>Yes</strong> for the facture, the facture isn't directly included in the sales book. Instead, it's processed by the outgoing VAT processing. For more information, see the <a href="#outgoingvatprocessing">Outgoing VAT processing</a> section.</p>
<p>The <strong>Operation type</strong> field shows a rule for facture processing. The system automatically assigns a value during the preliminary processing of export factures. However, you can manually change the value. For more information about operation types, see the <a href="#preliminaryprocessingexportfactures">Preliminary processing of export factures</a> and <a href="#operation">Operation types</a> sections.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information about export factures, see the <a href="#createfactureexport">Create a facture for export sales</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="processing-export-factures">Processing export factures</h2>
<p>The preliminary processing of export factures determines the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The moment of tax base calculation</li>
<li>The operation type that the facture corresponds to during the reporting period</li>
</ul>
<p>When the amount of tax that must be charged to the budget is determined, either the 0-percent rate or the rate that is used in the domestic market is applied. The rate that is applied depends on the operation type that is assigned.</p>
<p>You can cancel the preliminary processing of export factures for current or previous periods.</p>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="#preliminaryprocessingexportfactures">Preliminary processing of export factures</a> section.</p>
<h3 id="operation"> Operation types</h3>
<p>VAT operation types are rules that are used for the preliminary processing of export factures. The system automatically assigns a value to a facture, based on the export date, confirmation date, and expiration date.</p>

<h2 id="default-operation-type">Default operation type</h2>
<p>You can set up a default operation type that is used for factures that haven't yet reached the time when an operation type is assigned to them. For example, the export confirmation deadline hasn't yet passed, and the system has left the <strong>Operation type</strong> field blank. However, if a default operation type is set on the <strong>Accounts receivable parameters</strong> page, it will be assigned to factures where the <strong>Operation type</strong> field is blank.</p>
<p>You can manually set up the following default operation types:</p>
<ul>
<li>VAT 0%</li>
<li>Unconfirmed VAT 0%</li>
</ul>
<p>Other operation types can't be manually set up as default operation types.</p>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="#setupdefaultoperationtype">Set up a default operation type</a> section.</p>
<h3 id="vat-operation-codes">VAT operation codes</h3>
<p>On the <strong>Parameters of VAT process</strong> page, you can define the parameters for outgoing VAT processing operations. You can then use the <strong>Outgoing VAT processing</strong> page to process the VAT transactions.</p>
<p>For every operation type, you must set up a default VAT operation code. VAT operation codes determine the following behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether factures are included in the sales book</li>
<li>Whether VAT transactions are posted to the ledger</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="#setupparametersvatprocess">Set up parameters for the VAT process</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="processing-of-outgoing-vat">Processing of outgoing VAT</h2>
<p>During the preliminary processing of export factures, the following actions occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>An operation type is assigned to the facture.</li>
<li>The required corrective factures are created.</li>
</ul>
<p>Posted corrective factures charge the VAT amount at the domestic tax rate.</p>
<p>These factures must be included in the sales book. Use the <strong>Outgoing VAT processing</strong> operation to include factures in the sales book. Before you run that operation, you must set up default VAT operation codes.</p>
<p>The <strong>Sales book (Outgoing VAT processing</strong>) page is designed like the <strong>Incoming VAT processing</strong> page in the <strong>Accounts payable</strong> module.</p>
<p>On the <strong>VAT processing log</strong> page, you can view the factures that have been processed and the transactions that have been created.</p>
<p>On the <strong>Sales book (Canceling processed VAT)</strong> page, you can cancel VAT that has been processed. When you post a cancellation of processing, tax and ledger transactions are generated. You can view the cancellation of VAT processing on the <strong>VAT processing log</strong> page.</p>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="#outgoingvatprocessing">Outgoing VAT processing</a> section.</p>
<h4 id="fine-calculation">Fine calculation</h4>
<p>The fine amount is calculated based on export factures that the confirmation was overdue for. For these factures, the tax payment also wasn't made on time. To determine the start date of the fine calculation, the system uses the tax reporting date of the period that the export date falls in. The fine amount is calculated for each facture. Factures are selected for calculation when the <strong>Facture source</strong> field is set to <strong>Invoice</strong> and the <strong>Operation type</strong> field is set to <strong>Overdue confirmation</strong>.</p>
<p>For each day of delay, the fine amount is calculated by using the following formula:</p>
<p><em>Fine amount</em> = (<em>Amount of overdue payment</em> × <em>Refinancing rate</em>) ÷ (100 × <em>Factor</em>)</p>
<p>If the refinancing rate changed within the payment delay period, the fine amount is calculated in two stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>The periods that have different current refinancing rates are calculated separately.</li>
<li>The fine amounts for periods are summarized.</li>
</ol>
<p>The number of days is counted from the twenty-first day of the month after the month when export was allowed through the date of VAT payment to the budget. (The month when export was allowed is taken from the <strong>Export date</strong> field.)</p>
<p>The accrual of the fine in accounting is reflected on the date of payment by a voucher:</p>
<p><strong>D99 - K68 / VAT / Fine on the calculated fine amount</strong></p>
<p>The amount of paid fines can't be refunded.</p>
<p>Before fines are calculated, you must set up the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The refinancing rate percentage and factor for calculation. These values are specified on the date that is set on the <strong>Refinancing rate</strong> page. For more information, see the <a href="#refinancingrate">Set up a refinancing rate and factor for fine calculation</a> section.</li>
<li>The main account for fine accounting in the event of overdue payment of tax. For more information, see the <a href="#mainaccountfineaccounting">Set up a main account for fine accounting</a> section.</li>
<li>The reporting date of the period that the export date falls in. For more information, see the <a href="#finecalculation">Set up a reporting date for fine calculation</a> section.</li>
