<p>This topic walks you through the process of setting up Making Tax Digital (MTD) for value-added tax (VAT) in the United Kingdom (UK).</p>
<h2 id="making-tax-digital--vat-statement-submission">Making Tax Digital – VAT statement submission</h2>
<p>On July 13, 2017, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster General in the UK announced that MTD for VAT would take effect on April 1, 2019.</p>
<p>MTD introduces an obligation for VAT-registered businesses to keep their records digitally (for VAT purposes only) and to provide VAT return information to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) through software that is functionally compatible with MTD. As of April 1, 2019, MTD for VAT is mandatory for businesses that have turnover that exceeds the VAT registration threshold (currently £85,000). For VAT-registered businesses that have turnover that is below the VAT registration threshold, MTD for VAT will remain voluntary until 2020 at the earliest.</p>
<p>VAT returns must be submitted to HMRC by using software that is compatible with MTD. VAT returns can no longer be submitted by using the HMRC portal. Software that is compatible with MTD must support the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The required records are stored in digital form.</li>
<li>The required records are preserved in digital form for up to six years.</li>
<li>A VAT return can be created from the digital records that are held in functionally compatible software, and this information can be digitally provided to HMRC.</li>
<li>The company can provide VAT data to HMRC on a voluntary basis.</li>
<li>The MTD for VAT application programming interface (API) platform can be used to receive information from HMRC about a relevant entity's compliance with obligations under the regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the UK, VAT returns are filed quarterly or monthly. The deadline for submitting a VAT return online and paying HMRC is one calendar month plus seven days after the end of the VAT period.</p>
<p>As HMRC states on the official website, the current amendment process will stay in place for VAT:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the net value of the errors on the VAT return is less than £10,000, the company will amend those errors on the next VAT return.</li>
<li>If the net value of the errors exceeds £10,000, the company must complete the VAT 652 form, which is available on the Gov.UK website.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about MTD for VAT, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/making-tax-digital-reforms-affecting-businesses/making-tax-digital-for-vat-legislation-overview">Making Tax Digital for VAT: legislation overview</a>.</p>
<p>As HMRC mentions in the Making Tax Digital for Business VAT Guide for Vendors, users must sign up for the MTD service for VAT, even if they have already signed up to use the MTD service for income tax. For more information about how to get ready for MTD, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-tax-digital-how-vat-businesses-and-other-vat-entities-can-get-ready">Making Tax Digital: how VAT businesses and other VAT entities can get ready</a>.</p>
<p>The solution that supports the [MTD for VAT requirements] (<a href="https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/vat-api/1.0">https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/vat-api/1.0</a>) is based on the Electronic messages functionality. This functionality provides a flexible approach for setting up and supporting reporting processes. The setup package for MTD for VAT for the UK covers the following scope of interoperation to help companies in the UK meet their VAT obligations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retrieve VAT obligations (Mandatory)</strong> – Users can initiate a request to HMRC to obtain their company's VAT obligations for a specific period. In response to each user's request, HMRC will post information about the company's VAT obligations as that information is defined in the company's profile on the HMRC side. VAT obligations contain information about the VAT period, the due date for submission, and the status of the obligation. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance will reflect this information.</li>
<li><strong>Submit VAT return for period (Mandatory)</strong> – The system collects information about VAT returns. The information that is collected is based on the sales tax payment transactions that have been posted in the system by using the sales tax settlement process, with respect to the VAT obligations that are registered in the system. After this information is collected, a VAT return report in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format is generated. The user will submit this report to HMRC. Dynamics 365 Finance will reflect the HMRC response to the submission.</li>
<li><strong>Retrieve VAT liabilities (Optional)</strong> – Users can initiate a request to HMRC to obtain their company's VAT liabilities for a specific period. In response to each user's request, HMRC will post information about the company's VAT liabilities as that information is defined in the company's profile on the HMRC side. This information will be stored in Finance as an attachment of the related electronic message. This attachment will be in JSON format.</li>
<li><strong>Retrieve VAT payments (Optional)</strong> – Users can initiate a request to HMRC to obtain their company's VAT payments for a specific period. In response to each user's request, HMRC will post information about the company's VAT payments as that information is defined in the company's profile on the HMRC side. This information will be stored in Finance as an attachment of the related electronic message. This attachment will be in JSON format.</li>
</ul>
<p>The setup package for MTD for VAT for the UK doesn't cover the View VAT Return endpoint that might be required. However, the Electronic messages functionality lets you set up and support this endpoint.</p>
<p>After a company is signed up for the MTD service for VAT in HMRC, it should complete the following tasks. These tasks will prepare Finance to interoperate with the HMRC web service to retrieve VAT obligations and submit VAT returns.</p>
<ul>
<li>Import and set up Electronic reporting (ER) configurations.</li>
<li>Set up application-specific parameters.</li>
<li>Import a package of data entities that includes a predefined electronic message setup.</li>
<li>Set up General ledger parameters.</li>
<li>Define a sales tax settlement period.</li>
<li>Set up security roles for electronic message processing.</li>
<li>Set up security roles to access the access token of the web application.</li>
<li>Initialize the web application for interoperation with HMRC.</li>
<li>Obtain an authorization code for the sandbox environment. This authorization code is for testing purposes only.</li>
<li>Obtain an authorization code for the production environment.</li>
<li>Obtain an access token.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="set-up-application-specific-parameters">Set up application-specific parameters</h2>
<p>Nine boxes on the VAT declaration for the UK must contain values that are calculated based on the tax transactions that are selected. These transactions depend on a set of criteria such as the transaction direction, the tax code, the country or region code of the tax code, and the tax type (item or service). Application-specific parameters let users influence the collection of tax transactions that must be considered during the calculation of the reporting value in each box. For the VAT declaration, there is a <strong>ReportFieldLookup</strong> application-specific parameter. The following table describes the result values that are available for this parameter.</p>

<p>Before you start to use the <strong>VAT Declaration JSON (UK)</strong> and <strong>VAT Declaration Excel (UK)</strong> formats, you must set up the <strong>ReportFieldLookup</strong> application-specific parameter. You can download an example of this setup from the Shared asset library in LCS. In the Shared asset library, select the <strong>Data package</strong> asset type, find the <strong>UK MTD VAT ReportFieldLookup v1.xml</strong> file in the list of data package files, and download it.</p>
<p>To set up the <strong>ReportFieldLookup</strong> application-specific parameter in the system, open the <strong>Electronic reporting</strong> workspace, and then, in the configuration tree, select the <strong>VAT Declaration JSON (UK)</strong> format. On the Action Pane, on the <strong>Configurations</strong> tab, in the <strong>Application specific parameters</strong> group, select <strong>Setup</strong>, and then select the version of the format that you want to use. To use the example of this setup, select <strong>Import</strong> on the Action Pane, and then select the file that you previously downloaded. To manually define conditions, select <strong>ReportFieldLookup</strong> on the <strong>Lookups</strong> FastTab, and then specify criteria on the <strong>Conditions</strong> FastTab. You can also use the example file as a starting point to set up conditions. When you've finished setting up conditions, change the value of the <strong>State</strong> field to <strong>Completed</strong>, save your changes, and close the page.</p>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>We recommend that you set up the <strong>Other</strong> value as the last condition in the list. Although this value isn't used in the <strong>VAT Declaration JSON (UK)</strong> format, it must be set to <strong>Not blank</strong> for both columns of the criteria.</p>
</div>
<p>You can easily export the setup of application-specific parameters from one version of a report and import it into another version. You can also export the setup from one report and import it into another report, provided that both reports have the same structure of lookup fields. When your setup is ready, export it, and then import it into the <strong>VAT Declaration Excel (UK)</strong> format.</p>
<h2 id="import-a-package-of-data-entities-that-includes-a-predefined-electronic-message-setup">Import a package of data entities that includes a predefined electronic message setup</h2>
<p>The process of setting up the Electronic messages functionality for MTD for VAT has many steps. Because the names of some predefined entities are used in the ER configurations, it's important that you use a set of predefined values that are delivered in a package of data entities for the related tables.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://lcs.dynamics.com/v2">LCS</a>, go to the Shared asset library, and select the <strong>Data package</strong> asset type. Then find <strong>UK MTD-VAT setup.zip</strong> in the list of data package files, and download it to your computer.</p>
<p>After the UK MTD-VAT setup.zip file is downloaded, open Finance, select the company that you will interoperate with HMRC from, and then go to <strong>Workspaces</strong> &gt; <strong>Data management</strong>.</p>
<p>Before you import setup data from the package of data entities, follow these steps to make sure that the data entities in your application are refreshed and synced.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Data management</strong> workspace, go to <strong>Framework parameters</strong> &gt; <strong>Entity settings</strong>, and then select <strong>Refresh entity list</strong>. Wait for confirmation that the refresh has been completed. For more information about how to refresh the entity list, see <a href="../../dev-itpro/data-entities/data-entities.md#entity-list-refresh">Entity list refresh</a>.</li>
<li>Validate that the source data and target data are correctly mapped. For more information, see the section about validation in <a href="../../dev-itpro/data-entities/data-import-export-job.md#validate-that-the-source-data-and-target-data-are-mapped-correctly">Data import and export jobs</a>.</li>
<li>Before the data entities are used for the first time to import the data from the package, sync the mapping of source data and target data. In the list for the package, select a data entity, and then, on the Action Pane, select <strong>Modify target mapping</strong>. Then, above the grid for the package, select <strong>Generate mapping</strong> to create a mapping from scratch.</li>
<li>Save the mapping.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3 through 4 for each data entity in the package before you start the import.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information about data management, see <a href="../../dev-itpro/data-entities/data-entities-data-packages.md">Data management</a>.</p>
<p>You must now import data from the UK MTD-VAT setup.zip file into the selected company. In the <strong>Data management</strong> workspace, select <strong>Import</strong>, and set the <strong>Source data format</strong> field to <strong>Package</strong>. Select <strong>Upload and add</strong>, select the <strong>UK MTD-VAT setup.zip</strong> file on your computer, and upload it.</p>
<p><img src="media/emea-gbr-mtd-vat-add-file.png" alt="Upload and add button"></p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="../../dev-itpro/data-entities/data-entities-data-packages.md?toc=/fin-and-ops/toc.json">Data management</a>.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Some records in the data entities in the package include a link to ER configurations. It's important that you import ER configurations into Finance before you start to import the data entities package.</p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>UK MTD-VAT setup</strong> package provides a setup for two sets of processing that can be used independently:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UK MTD VAT returns</strong> – For interoperation with the <strong>production</strong> HMRC web service.</li>
<li><strong>UK MTD VAT TEST</strong> – For interoperation with the <strong>sandbox</strong> HMRC web service.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>UK MTD-VAT setup</strong> package also provides a setup for two web applications that are used to interoperate with HMRC web services:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamics 365 Finance</strong> – For interoperation with the <strong>production</strong> HMRC web service.</li>
<li><strong>Sandbox HMRC</strong> – For interoperation with the <strong>sandbox</strong> HMRC web service.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you import the setup of Electronic messages functionality for MTD for VAT from the <strong>UK MTD-VAT setup</strong> package that Microsoft provides, credentials for the <strong>Dynamics 365 Finance</strong> web application are imported into your system and stored in encrypted format. These credentials are provided by Microsoft and will be used for production interoperation with HMRC.</p>
<p>For more information about the predefined setup that is included in the data entities in the package for MTD for VAT, see <a href="#appendix-1-electronic-messages-setup-for-mtd-for-vat">Appendix 1: Electronic messages setup for MTD for VAT</a> later in this topic.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-general-ledger-parameters">Set up General ledger parameters</h2>
<p>On the <strong>General ledger parameters</strong> page, you must set up the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number sequences</li>
<li>VAT statement format mapping</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="number-sequences">Number sequences</h3>
<p>To work with the Electronic messages functionality, you must define related number sequences.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>General ledger parameters</strong>.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Number sequences</strong> tab, set up two number sequences:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Message</li>
<li>Message item</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vat-statement-format-mapping">VAT statement format mapping</h3>
<p>You can generate a paper format of the <strong>VAT 100</strong> report by using the <strong>Report sales tax for settlement period</strong> dialog box (<strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Declarations</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Report sales tax for settlement period</strong>). Alternatively, you can generate the statement for a selected sales tax payment transaction from the <strong>Sales tax payments</strong> page (<strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Inquiries and reports</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales tax inquiries</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales tax payments</strong>). In both cases, the <strong>VAT 100</strong> report is generated in Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) format.</p>
<p>To generate the <strong>VAT 100</strong> report in Excel format instead of SSRS format, you must define an ER format on the <strong>General ledger parameters</strong> page.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>General ledger parameters</strong>.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Sales tax</strong> tab, in the <strong>Tax options</strong> section, in the <strong>VAT statement format mapping</strong> field, select <strong>VAT Declaration Excel (UK)</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you leave the <strong>VAT statement format mapping</strong> field blank, the <strong>VAT 100</strong> report will be generated in SSRS format.</p>
<h2 id="define-a-sales-tax-settlement-period">Define a sales tax settlement period</h2>
<p>Electronic message processing that is defined for MTD for VAT in the UK MTD-VAT setup.zip file is company-agnostic. Therefore, it can be implemented in any legal entity in Finance.</p>
<p>Both the <strong>UK MTD VAT returns</strong> processing (for production) and the <strong>UK MTD VAT TEST</strong> processing (for testing purposes) let you collect sales tax payment transactions in the legal entity. You can then generate a VAT return in JSON or Excel format, for either production purposes or testing purposes. The collection of sales tax payment transactions is implemented by using the <strong>Populate VAT return records</strong> action of the <strong>Populate record</strong> type. To correctly collect sales tax payment transactions, you must define a sales tax settlement period for the <strong>Populate VAT return records</strong> action.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Electronic messages</strong> &gt; <strong>Populate records actions</strong>, and select <strong>Populate VAT return records</strong>. 2. On the <strong>Datasource setup</strong> FastTab, select the <strong>VAT payment</strong> record, and then select <strong>Edit query</strong>.</li>
<li>For the <strong>Settlement period</strong> field of the <strong>Sales tax payments</strong> table, define the sales tax settlement period when tax transactions from the selected legal entity must be reported to HMRC.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="media/emea-gbr-sales-tax-inquiry.png" alt="Sales tax inquiry"></p>
<p>If you don't set the <strong>Settlement period</strong> field, all tax transactions from the selected legal entity will be considered for reporting for MTD for VAT.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-security-roles-for-electronic-message-processing">Set up security roles for electronic message processing</h2>
<p>Different groups of users might require access to different electronic message processing (<strong>UK MTD VAT TEST</strong> or <strong>UK MTD VAT return</strong>). You can limit access to each type of processing, based on security groups that are defined in the system.</p>
<p>Complete the following steps to limit access to the <strong>UK MTD VAT TEST</strong> processing.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Electronic messages</strong> &gt; <strong>Electronic message processing</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>UK MTD VAT TEST</strong> processing, and add the security groups that must work with this processing for testing purposes. If no security group is defined for the processing, only a system admin can see the processing on the <strong>Electronic messages</strong> page.</li>
</ol>
<p>Complete the following steps to limit access to the <strong>UK MTD VAT returns</strong> processing.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Electronic messages</strong> &gt; <strong>Electronic message processing</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>UK MTD VAT returns</strong> processing, and add the security groups that must work with this processing for real-life interoperation with the production HMRC environment. If no security group is defined for the processing, only a system admin can see the processing on the <strong>Electronic messages</strong> page.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="set-up-security-roles-to-access-the-access-token-of-the-web-application">Set up security roles to access the access token of the web application</h2>
<p>When an access token to each HMRC web application (production and sandbox) is retrieved from HMRC, it's stored in the system database in an encrypted format. The access token must be used whenever a request of any type will be sent to HMRC. For security reasons, access to the access token must be limited to security groups that must send requests to HMRC. If users who aren't in one of those security groups try to send a request to HMRC, a message notifies them that they aren't allowed to interoperate by using the selected web application.</p>
<p>Complete the following steps to set up security groups that must have access to HMRC's access token for MTD for VAT.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Electronic messages</strong> &gt; <strong>Web applications</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the web application that you want to define security groups for, and then add those security groups on the <strong>Security roles</strong> FastTab.</li>
</ol>
<p>If security roles aren't defined for a web application, only a system admin can interoperate by using the selected web application.</p>
<h2 id="initialize-the-web-application-for-interoperation-with-hmrc">Initialize the web application for interoperation with HMRC</h2>
<p>Three parameters uniquely identify each web application on the HMRC side:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Client ID</strong> – The unique identifier of the web application.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Client secret</strong> – The secret passphrase that is used to authorize the web application.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Server token</strong> – The secret token that is used to authorize the web application when requests are made to any application-restricted endpoint.</p>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>The server token has been deprecated on the HMRC side and is no longer in use.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These parameters are used when requests are sent to HMRC. They must be filled in before you start the authorization process for a web application.</p>
<p>For the production web application (<strong>Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations</strong>), Microsoft delivers these parameters through the package of data entities, and they are stored in the system in an encrypted format. When you import the predefined setup of Electronic messages functionality for MTD for VAT, these parameters are also imported. No additional manual actions are required. After the parameters are imported, the production application is ready for authorization.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Electronic messages</strong> &gt; <strong>Web applications</strong>, and verify that <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client secret</strong> values are set for the <strong>Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations</strong> web application.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="media/uk-mtd-credentials-setup.png" alt="Web application credentials"></p>
<p>Don't edit the record by changing or updating these values. Additionally, you don't have to create a web application of the production type on the HMRC side, because the <strong>Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations</strong> web application is completely ready to interoperate in live with the production MTD service for VAT. The next steps should be to obtain and authorization code and an access token.</p>
<p>For the sandbox web application (<strong>Sandbox HMRC</strong>), you can manually obtain <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client secret</strong> values from the <strong>Manage credentials</strong> section of your sandbox application in the HMRC portal.</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the parameters, and then, in Finance, open the <strong>Web applications</strong> page.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Electronic messages</strong> &gt; <strong>Web applications</strong> and select the <strong>Sandbox HMRC</strong> web application.</li>
<li>On the <strong>General</strong> FastTab, in the <strong>Authorization parameters</strong> section, paste the parameters into the appropriate fields.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="obtain-an-authorization-code-for-the-production-environment">Obtain an authorization code for the production environment</h2>
<p>When a company is ready to interoperate in live with MTD for VAT, it must create an HMRC online account (Government Gateway account), unless an account already exists. Next, the company must link the online account to the Finance application by selecting <strong>Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance</strong> as the software. It will then obtain user credentials (a user ID and password) that are linked to its VAT registration number:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User ID</strong> – The name that is used to access HMRC while an authorization code is being requested.</li>
<li><strong>Password</strong> – The password that is used to access HMRC while an authorization code is being requested.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you can work with MTD for VAT, the VAT registration number of your legal entity must be defined in the registration ID. For more information, see <a href="emea-registration-ids.html">Registration IDs</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create a registration type that you will use for VAT registration numbers. For more information, see <a href="emea-registration-ids.html#registration-type-creation">Registration type</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Associate the registration type created in step 1 with a registration category of <strong>VAT ID</strong>. For more information, see <a href="emea-registration-ids.html#supported-registration-categories">Registration category</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Organization administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Global Address Book</strong> &gt; <strong>Legal entities</strong>, and then, on the Action Pane, select <strong>Registration ID</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Define the VAT registration number as a registration ID that is associated with the registration category of <strong>VAT ID</strong> that you created in step 2.</p>
<p><img src="media/reg-ids-setup.png" alt="Registration ID setup"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After the company has obtained user credentials, an application of the production type can be authorized. An application of production type is uniquely identified by a client ID and a client secret, and is provided by Microsoft (unless the company is creating its own solution for any version of Finance). To authorize the application of the production type, complete the following tasks on the Finance side:</p>
<ol>
<li>Obtain an authorization code.</li>
<li>Obtain an access token.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="obtain-an-authorization-code">Obtain an authorization code</h3>
<p>To get an authorization code from HMRC, complete the following steps.</p>

<h2 id="obtain-an-authorization-code-for-the-sandbox-environment">Obtain an authorization code for the sandbox environment</h2>
<p>For testing purposes, HMRC lets you register as a developer on <a href="https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/registration">HMRC Developer Hub</a> and access the sandbox environment. When you're registered as a developer, you can use the <strong>UK MTD VAT TEST</strong> processing to try to interoperate with the HMRC sandbox environment. However, you must first get test user credentials:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User ID</strong> – The name that is used to access HMRC while an authorization code is being requested.</li>
<li><strong>Password</strong> – The password that is used to access HMRC while an authorization code is being requested.</li>
<li><strong>VRN</strong> – The testing VAT registration number (VRN) that is used during testing of interoperation with the HMRC sandbox environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three parameters must be used together.</p>
<p>To get test user credentials, complete the following steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Complete the steps described in the <a href="https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-test-user">Create a test user</a> section of the HMRC portal.</li>
<li>The test user generated in the <a href="https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-test-user">Create a test user</a> section contains information about <strong>UserID</strong>, <strong>Password</strong>, and <strong>Making Tax Digital Income Tax ID</strong> fields, and their respective values.</li>
<li>Update the <strong>Tax exempt number</strong> value of the legal entity that you're working in with the <strong>Making Tax Digital Income Tax ID</strong> value that you obtained from HMRC. Don't change this value while you're working with the sandbox web application, unless you get new test user credentials.</li>
<li>Store the <strong>UserID</strong> and <strong>Password</strong> values related to the test user that you created. You will need these values during next steps of the authorization process.</li>
</ol>
<p>After you've updated the <strong>Tax exempt number</strong> value of the legal entity that you're working in, you can proceed with authorization in HMRC. You must complete the following two tasks before your system is authorized to interoperate with HMRC:</p>

<p>The <strong>Action log</strong> FastTab saves information about the user, and the date and time when the electronic message was created.</p>
<p>No additional fields are applicable to this type of electronic message.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Select <strong>Send report</strong> to initialize the retrieval of VAT obligation information from HMRC. In the <strong>Run processing</strong> dialog box, the <strong>Retrieve VAT obligations</strong> action is automatically defined, and information is filled in by the system.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong>. A request in JSON format is created and sent to the HMRC web application. The response that is received from HMRC will be attached to the electronic message.

<p>HMRC uniquely identifies each VAT return period via a <strong>periodKey</strong> parameter. This parameter is stored in Finance. However, according to HMRC requirements, its value must be hidden in the UI. Users must not be able to see the <strong>periodKey</strong> value in the UI.</p>
<p>The <strong>periodKey</strong> additional field is used to store the <strong>periodKey</strong> value in both the <strong>UK MTD VAT TEST</strong> processing and the <strong>UK MTD VAT returns</strong> processing. This field is set up as a hidden field, so that users can't see its value. To comply with HMRC requirements, you should not change this setup for the <strong>periodKey</strong> additional field.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows the lifecycle of electronic message processing for the retrieval of VAT obligations.</p>
<p><img src="media/mkd-process.png" alt="Lifecycle of electronic message processing for VAT obligation retrieval"></p>
<p>The last step of the processing is an <strong>Import VAT obligations</strong> action of the <strong>Electronic reporting import</strong> type. The system defines the following behavior for this step:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a VAT obligation from the response doesn't exist in the database, and the status of this VAT obligation in HMRC is <strong>Open</strong>, a new electronic message is created that has a status of <strong>New VAT return</strong>.</li>
<li>If a VAT obligation from the response doesn't exist in the database, and the status of this VAT obligation in HMRC is <strong>Fulfilled</strong>, a new electronic message is created that has a status of <strong>Completed VAT return</strong>.</li>
<li>If a VAT obligation from the response does exist in the database, the system verifies the values of the <strong>HMRC status</strong>, <strong>Due date</strong>, and <strong>Received date</strong> additional fields, and syncs them with the information from the response.</li>

<p>HMRC lets you simulate different scenarios of VAT obligation retrieval in the sandbox web application. For example, QUARTERLY_NONE_MET simulates a scenario where the client has quarterly obligations, but none of those obligations are fulfilled. You can find related information in the &quot;Endpoints&quot; paragraph of the &quot;VAT&quot; subscription <a href="https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/vat-api/1.0">API documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="collect-data-for-a-vat-return">Collect data for a VAT return</h2>
<p>The process of preparing and submitting a VAT return for a period is based on sales tax payment transactions that were posted during the <a href="../general-ledger/tasks/create-sales-tax-payment.html">Settle and post sales tax</a> job. For more information about sales tax settlement and reporting, see <a href="../general-ledger/indirect-taxes-overview.html">Sales tax overview</a>.</p>
<p>Before you start to prepare and submit a VAT return to HMRC, complete the regular <strong>Settle and post sales tax</strong> job for the period that you will report to HMRC. When this job is run, new sales tax payment transactions are created. To view these sales tax payments, go to <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Inquiries and reports</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales tax Inquiries</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales tax payments</strong>. You can review the resulting values for each sales tax payment transaction on the <strong>VAT 100</strong> report in SSRS or Excel format. For information about how to define the format that is used, see the <a href="#vat-statement-format-mapping">Set up General ledger parameters</a> section earlier in this topic. To generate a <strong>VAT 100</strong> report for selected sales tax payment transactions, select <strong>Print report</strong> on the Action Pane.</p>
<p>You can run the <strong>Settle and post sales tax</strong> job several times for the same period before you submit a VAT return to HMRC. All the sales tax payment transactions can be included on the same VAT return report for a period. The transactions that the system fills in for reporting depend on the sales tax settlement period that is defined in the <strong>Populate VAT return records</strong> action for the processing. For more information, see the <a href="#define-a-sales-tax-settlement-period">Define a sales tax settlement period</a> section earlier in this topic.</p>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>MTD for VAT lets you submit a VAT return only one time for each reporting period. As HMRC states on the official website, the current amendment process will stay in place for VAT:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the net value of the errors on the VAT return is less than £10,000, the company will amend those errors on the next VAT return.</li>
<li>If the net value of the errors exceeds £10,000, the company must complete the VAT 652 form, which is available on the Gov.UK website.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When the <strong>Settle and post sales tax</strong> job is completed, you can start to prepare a report for electronic submission. The first step of data preparation is to collect sales tax payment transactions that are related to the period.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Inquiries and reports</strong> &gt; <strong>Electronic messages</strong> &gt; <strong>Electronic messages</strong>, and select either the <strong>UK MTD VAT TEST</strong> processing (for testing purposes) or the <strong>UK MTD VAT returns</strong> processing (for real-life interoperation with the production HMRC web application).</li>
<li>On the <strong>Message</strong> FastTab, select the electronic message that is related to the period that you want to submit a VAT return for. Don't update the <strong>Start date</strong> and <strong>End date</strong> fields of the record. These values are received from HMRC and will be used as criteria for collecting sales tax payment transactions. You can add a description of the electronic message. VAT data can be collected only for electronic messages that have a status of <strong>New VAT return</strong>.</li>
<li>To start to collect sales tax payment transactions, select <strong>Collect data</strong> on the <strong>Message</strong> FastTab. The <strong>Populate VAT return records</strong> action is predefined in the <strong>Run processing</strong> dialog box.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong>. The system collects the sales tax payment transactions that were posted in the period that is defined by the <strong>From date</strong> and <strong>To date</strong> fields. It then enters those transactions as electronic message items of the message. You can review the transactions on the <strong>Message items</strong> FastTab.</li>
</ol>
<p>If, for some reason, a sales tax payment transaction that the system entered must be excluded from the report, you can delete it. Alternatively, you can update its status to <strong>Excluded</strong> by selecting <strong>Update status</strong> on the <strong>Message items</strong> FastTab. Transactions that have a status of <strong>Excluded</strong> aren't considered for reporting. You can also change the status of a transaction from <strong>Excluded</strong> back to <strong>Populated</strong> by selecting <strong>Update status</strong> on the <strong>Message items</strong> FastTab.</p>
<p>You can repeatedly select <strong>Collect data</strong> on the <strong>Message</strong> FastTab until the electronic message is moved to the next status. After data is collected, select <strong>Update status</strong> on the <strong>Messages</strong> FastTab. The <strong>Ready to generate VAT return</strong> status is predefined in the <strong>Update status</strong> dialog box.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong> to mark the electronic message as ready for report generation. The status of the electronic message items that are linked to the electronic message is updated to <strong>To be reported</strong>.</li>
<li>If, for some reason, you must go back to step 4 and continue to collect data or change the status of electronic message items, select <strong>Update status</strong> on the <strong>Messages</strong> FastTab, select <strong>New VAT return</strong> in the <strong>New status</strong> field, and then select <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>Action log</strong> FastTab saves information about all the actions that are performed for the electronic message.</p>
<p>After an electronic message has a status of <strong>Ready to generate VAT return</strong>, you can initialize report generation. Two generation options are available:</p>
<ul>

</li>
<li><p>To remain compliant with HMRC requirements, you should not modify or delete this declaration text in the setup of the <strong>Submit VAT return</strong> action.

<p>A VAT return can be submitted to HMRC just one time for each period. Therefore, make sure that you want to submit the VAT return before you accept the declaration. If you aren't sure that the VAT return is ready to be submitted, select <strong>Cancel</strong>. When you select <strong>OK</strong>, the VAT return in JSON format that is related to the selected electronic message is submitted to HMRC. If the VAT return is successfully submitted to HMRC, the status of the electronic message is updated to <strong>Sent VAT return</strong>, and the response from HMRC is attached to the electronic message.</p>
<p>Next, the system automatically runs the <strong>Import response for VAT return</strong> action. This action reflects information from the response in the <strong>Processing date</strong> additional field of the electronic message. It updates the status of the electronic message to <strong>Completed VAT return</strong> and updates the status of the electronic message items to <strong>Submitted</strong>.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, the <strong>Import response for VAT return</strong> action isn't automatically run, you can manually initialize it by selecting <strong>Import response</strong> on the <strong>Messages</strong> FastTab.

<p>To prepare Finance to report a VAT return for a VAT group, make sure that your business processes and the system setup meet the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tax information from all the subsidiaries is registered in the same system (Finance).</li>
<li>The system correctly reflects all the tax transactions in accordance with the rules and principles of the UK.</li>
<li>Settlement periods for all the legal entities that are involved to the VAT group are identically defined in full accordance with the period intervals that are defined in the HMRC online account.</li>
<li>VAT settlement (the <a href="../general-ledger/tasks/create-sales-tax-payment.html">Settle and post sales tax</a> job) is done in each subsidiary legal entity.</li>
<li>A <strong>VAT 100</strong> report is correctly generated for preview in each subsidiary legal entity.</li>
<li>One legal entity is set up for interoperation with HMRC, according to the information in this topic, and users can request VAT obligations from this legal entity for the VAT group.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section of the topic explains how to perform the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up additional ER configurations to collect data from several legal entities for VAT return reporting for a VAT group.</li>
<li>Set up additional Electronic messages functionality, beyond the general setup for the MTD for VAT feature, to collect data from several legal entities for VAT return reporting for a VAT group.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Electronic messages</strong> page to collect information for VAT return reporting for several legal entities.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="import-and-set-up-er-configurations-to-collect-data-from-several-legal-entities-for-vat-return-reporting-for-a-vat-group">Import and set up ER configurations to collect data from several legal entities for VAT return reporting for a VAT group</h3>
<p>To prepare ER configurations to generate the common VAT return for a VAT group, based on tax transactions that are posted in several legal entities, import and use the following versions or later of the ER configurations.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>ER configuration name and version</th>
<th>Description</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Tax declaration model.version.<strong>32</strong></td>
<td>Generic model for different tax declarations.</td>

<p>In these versions and later, the tax declaration model, model mapping, and both formats for the UK VAT return support cross-company tax transaction data sources, and they can be used to aggregate data from several legal entities. These configurations can still be used to report the VAT return for just one legal entity.</p>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>These versions of the ER configurations are supported in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.7 and later. For Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition 7.3, you must install KB 4513052 and the latest version of the ER update.</p>
</div>
<p>To use the formats to report the VAT return for a group of several legal entities, you must set up application-specific parameters <strong>for each legal entity that is included into the group</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Electronic reporting</strong> workspace, select <strong>Tax declaration model</strong>, and then, in the configuration tree, select the <strong>MTD VAT returns exporting JSON (UK)</strong> format.</li>
<li>In the upper-right corner, select the legal entity that tax transactions must be included for in the VAT return for the VAT group.</li>
<li>On the Action Pane, on the <strong>Configurations</strong> tab, in the <strong>Application specific parameters</strong> group, select <strong>Setup</strong>. In the left pane of the <strong>Application specific parameters</strong> page, select the latest version of the format. Then, on the <strong>Conditions</strong> FastTab, define conditions.

Finally, change the status to <strong>Completed</strong>, save your changes, and close the <strong>Application specific parameters</strong> page.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2 through 3 for the other legal entities in your system that are included in the VAT group.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1 through 4 above for the <strong>MTD VAT returns exporting EXCEL (UK)</strong> format.</li>

<p>In Finance version 10.0.7 and later, users can prepare a VAT return report by collecting information from several legal entities into one ER format. For this purpose, the system must collect, in the same electronic message, sales tax payment transactions that were posted in different legal entities. The following steps must be done in addition to all the steps of the general setup process for the MTD for VAT feature.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Turn on the <strong>Cross-company queries for the populate records actions</strong> feature in Feature management. Go to <strong>Workspaces</strong> &gt; <strong>Feature management</strong>, find <strong>Cross-company queries for the populate records actions</strong> in the list, and then select <strong>Enable now</strong> in the lower right of the page.</p>

For existing records that were created during the general setup of the MTD for VAT feature, this field shows the identifier of the current legal entity. It's assumed that the settlement period for the current legal entity was set up during the general setup of the MTD for VAT feature.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Datasources setup</strong> grid, add a line for each additional legal entity that must be included in reporting for the VAT group. Set the following fields.</p>

<h2 id="fraud-prevention-headers">Fraud prevention headers</h2>
<p>To help prevent fraud, the HMRC APIs provide HTTP headers that must be used to pass audit data.</p>
<p>The set of HTTP headers that must be transmitted for fraud prevention varies, depending on the architecture of the environment that is used by the company that is interoperating with MTD for VAT. The <strong>Gov-Client-Connection-Method</strong> header must represent the connection method that is used for the request that the company makes. It's assumed that most companies that use Finance in a cloud architecture use the <strong>WEB_APP_VIA_SERVER</strong> connection method and interoperate with HMRC through the Electronic messages functionality. However, a user might instead initiate a batch job for interoperation with HMRC. In this case, the connection method will be transmitted as <strong>BATCH_PROCESS_DIRECT</strong>.</p>

<p>Request headers are composed in the <strong>MTD VAT web request headers format (UK)</strong> format in the <strong>Electronic reporting</strong> module. This format configuration was extended so that it includes the required nodes.</p>
<p><img src="media/format-new-nodes-all.png" alt="Nodes in the MTD VAT web request headers format (UK) format configuration"></p>
<p>To determine the corresponding values of the headers, the <strong>MTD VAT model mapping</strong> configuration can call the X++ methods. The Electronic Messages framework model was also extended so that it supports the included nodes that are used to map the values of fraud prevention headers.</p>
<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>To activate the transmission of fraud prevention headers during interoperation with the HMRC API, import the previously mentioned versions of the ER configurations from LCS.</p>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>When new versions of the ER configurations are imported, verify that following configurations are marked as <strong>Default for model mapping</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tax declaration model mapping</li>
<li>MTD VAT model mapping (UK)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When the ER configurations are imported, fraud prevention parameters will be transmitted as part of the HTTP request to HMRC.</p>
<p>If you initiate a request to the HMRC without activating a batch job, the <strong>Request identification information</strong> page informs you about the information that will be sent to HMRC.</p>
<p><img src="media/fraud-prevention-headers-message-page.png" alt="Request identification information page"></p>
<p>You must select the check box to consent to the transmission of the information that is listed on the page. The <strong>Submit</strong> button then becomes available, and you can select it to submit the request to HMRC.</p>
<p>If you cancel the transmission at this point by selecting <strong>Do not submit</strong>, the status of the electronic message is changed to <strong>Error</strong>, and a description of the error is attached to the action log. Select <strong>Send report</strong> to continue the transmission of the same electronic message.</p>
<p>When a request to HMRC in a batch job is initiated, the fraud prevention headers are transmitted to HMRC, and information about the headers that were sent is attached to the batch job. To view this information, go to <strong>System administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Inquiries</strong> &gt; <strong>Batch jobs</strong>, and select your batch job. To review the log details, select <strong>Batch job</strong> &gt; <strong>Log</strong> on the Action Pane.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, a company decides to send requests to HMRC without transmitting fraud prevention headers, the version of the format that includes the fraud prevention headers can be deleted or not imported at all. Alternatively, you can disable these headers in the <strong>MTD VAT web request headers format (UK)</strong> format in the <strong>Electronic reporting</strong> module by following these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the ER configurations tree, select the <strong>MTD VAT web request headers format (UK)</strong> format, and derive a new child format. For more information, see <a href="../../dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting.md#building-a-format-selecting-another-format-as-a-base-customization">Building a format selecting another format as a base</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the Action Pane, select <strong>Designer</strong> to open the child format in the designer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>Gov-Client-Connection-Method</strong> node, and set the <strong>Enabled</strong> property to <strong>false</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="media/format-disable-nodes.png" alt="Enabled property set to false"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 1 through 3 for other fraud prevention headers. These headers include <strong>Gov-Client-Timezone</strong>, <strong>Gov-Client-User-Agent</strong>, <strong>Gov-Vendor-Version</strong>, and <strong>Gov-Client-MAC-Addresses</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Save and complete the configuration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Electronic reporting</strong> &gt; <strong>Web service settings</strong>. In the <strong>Request headers format mapping</strong> field of all the web services that are used for interoperation with HMRC, select the child format instead of the parent format that is used by default.</p>
<p><img src="media/web-service-format-setup.png" alt="Child format selected in the Request headers format mapping field"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>HMRC might reject API requests that don't include fraud prevention headers. We recommend that you include fraud prevention headers in the API requests that you send to HMRC.</p>
</div>
<p>When at least one fraud prevention header about the originating device is enabled, a list of all parameters that were defined during the request to the HMRC API is shown. However, only the enabled parameters are transmitted as part of the request.</p>
<h2 id="system-admin-consent-is-required-to-allow-fraud-prevention-headers-transmission-to-hmrc">System admin consent is required to allow fraud prevention headers transmission to HMRC</h2>
<p>To help prevent fraud, HMRC requires the transmission of additional information (fraud prevention parameters) that is collected from the user devices that are used to submit VAT requests. Fraud prevention parameters are used to uniquely identify all requests to the HMRC VAT APIs.</p>
<p>The system admin of the company that transmits VAT data together with fraud prevention parameters must consent one time for each web application that is used for interoperation with the HMRC VAT APIs. Otherwise, data that is collected from the user devices that are used to submit VAT requests can't be transmitted.</p>
<p>This change is supported in Finance version 10.0.8 and later.</p>

<h3 id="system-admin-consent">System admin consent</h3>
<p>After the ER configurations from the previous table are successfully imported, system admin must follow these steps in the legal entity that interoperates with HMRC. (It's assumed that the setup for the MTD for VAT feature has been completed.)</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Electronic messages</strong> &gt; <strong>Web applications</strong>, select the web application that you want to use for interoperation with the MTD for VAT APIs, and then, on the Action Pane, select <strong>Get authorization code</strong>. This step must be completed even if the web application has previously been successfully authorized.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Electronic report parameters</strong> page, in the <strong>Scope</strong> field, enter <strong>write:vat read:vat</strong>, and then select <strong>OK</strong> to continue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>System administrator consent</strong> dialog box that appears, read the information, select the check box to give your consent, and then select <strong>Agree</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="media/uk-mtd-system-administrator-consent.png" alt="System administrator consent dialog box"></p>
<p>A new record of the <strong>System administrator consent received</strong> type will be stored in the action log of the related web application.</p>
<p><img src="media/uk-mtd-system-administrator-consent-log.png" alt="System administrator consent received record in the action log"></p>
</li>
<li><p>If your web application wasn't previously authorized, continue the <a href="#obtain-an-authorization-code-for-the-production-environment">authorization process</a> as it's described in this topic. If your web application was previously authorized on the HMRC side, you don't need to continue the authorization process and can skip all other authorization steps.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the ER configurations from previous table were successfully imported, but the system admin didn't give consent, requests to refresh the access token will be blocked. In this case, because the old access token will be used, HMRC will accept no new requests to the MTD for VAT APIs. For example, a user who sends a new VAT obligations request to HMRC will receive a &quot;401&quot; error. The message details will state, &quot;Access token cannot be refreshed. System administrator must consent to transmit information outside of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations via initialization 'Get authorization code' button on Web applications page.&quot;</p>
<p><img src="media/uk-mtd-system-administrator-consent-log-error.png" alt="Error message if system admin consent wasn't given"></p>
<h2 id="using-the-mtd-feature-outside-the-uk">Using the MTD feature outside the UK</h2>
<p>A company that is registered for VAT in the territory of the UK might have a primary address that is outside the UK. To simplify adoption of the MTD for VAT feature in legal entities that have a primary address outside the UK, the following ER formats are delivered without any <strong>ISO country/region code</strong> parameter:</p>
<ul>
<li>MTD VAT return response importing JSON (UK).version.19.10</li>
<li>MTD VAT import token format (UK).version.19.8</li>
<li>MTD VAT web request headers format (UK).version.22.22</li>
<li>MTD VAT authorization format (UK).version.19.7</li>
<li>MTD VAT interoperation (UK).version.31.8</li>
<li>MTD VAT obligations importing JSON (UK).version.31.9</li>
</ul>
<p>When these ER formats and later versions of them are used, the MTD for VAT feature can be set up and used in legal entities that have a primary address in any country or region.</p>
<p>The following ER formats are used to generate a VAT declaration (<strong>VAT 100</strong> report in Excel format and VAT return in JSON format):</p>
<ul>
<li>VAT Declaration JSON (UK)</li>
<li>VAT Declaration Excel (UK)</li>
</ul>
<p>For these formats, the <strong>ISO country/region code</strong> parameter is still set to <strong>GB</strong>.</p>
<p>When a company that has a primary address outside the UK uses MTD for VAT, it's important that the VAT setup in the related legal entity be completed according to UK rules. VAT management must be done in an appropriate manner, so that a VAT declaration is correctly generated according to HMRC requirements.</p>
<p>When a company that has a primary address outside the UK considers VAT management in the legal entity, it must follow these steps to set up the MTD for VAT feature.</p>
<ol>
<li>Derive the <strong>VAT Declaration JSON (UK)</strong> ER format, and then, for the child configuration, define the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) country/region code that is related to the ISO code in the primary address of this legal entity. You can complete this step on the <strong>ISO country/region code</strong> FastTab for the selected format.</li>
<li>Derive the <strong>VAT Declaration Excel (UK)</strong> ER format, and then, for the child configuration, define the ISO country/region code that is related to the ISO code in the primary address of this legal entity. You can complete this step on the <strong>ISO country/region code</strong> FastTab for the selected format.</li>
<li>Import or set up application-specific parameters for the child configurations of the <strong>VAT Declaration JSON (UK)</strong> and <strong>VAT Declaration Excel (UK)</strong> formats.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Electronic messages</strong> &gt; <strong>Message processing</strong>, and select <strong>Generate file for submission</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Format mapping</strong> field, select the child configuration of the <strong>VAT Declaration JSON (UK)</strong> format.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Electronic messages</strong> page, select <strong>Message processing</strong>, and then select <strong>Preview VAT return</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Format mapping</strong> field, select the child configuration of the <strong>VAT Declaration Excel (UK)</strong> format.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <strong>VAT return report creation for companies reporting as VAT group within the same system database</strong> feature is supported in Finance version 10.0.7 and later.</p>

<p>This hotfix delivers the same fix that was previously released in KB 4525191 for model version 32, which has a dependency on Finance version 10.0.7. However, this hotfix is for the previous version of the model, version 31, which has no dependency on the application version. Therefore, the issue can be fixed in all application versions that are earlier than 10.0.7.</p>
<p>The hotfix is delivered in the following version of the ER configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tax declaration model mapping <strong>(servicing)</strong>.version.<strong>31.34.1</strong></li>
