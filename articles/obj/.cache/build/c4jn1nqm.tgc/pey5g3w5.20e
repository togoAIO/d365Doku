<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce version 10.0.10 and later, inbound and outbound operations in the point of sale (POS) replace the picking and receiving operation.</p>
<div class="NOTE" sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">In Commerce version 10.0.10 and later, any new features in the POS application that are related to receiving store inventory against purchase orders and transfer orders will be added to the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">Inbound operation</strong> POS operation. If you're currently using the picking and receiving operation in POS, we recommend that you develop a strategy for moving from that operation to the new inbound and outbound operations. Although the picking and receiving operation won't be removed from the product, there will be no further investments in it, from a functional or performance perspective, after version 10.0.9.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="prerequisite-configure-an-asynchronous-document-framework" sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="43">Prerequisite: Configure an asynchronous document framework</h2>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="45">The inbound operation includes performance improvements to ensure that users who have high volumes of receipt postings across many stores or companies, and large inventory documents, can process those documents to Commerce Headquarters without experiencing time-outs or failures. These improvements require use of an asynchronous document framework.</p>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="47">When an asynchronous document framework is used, you can commit inbound document changes from POS to Commerce Headquarters and then move on to other tasks while the processing to Commerce Headquarters occurs in the background. You can check the status of a document through the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="47">Inbound operation</strong> document list page in POS to make sure that posting was successful. In the POS application, you can also use the inbound operation active document list to see any documents that could not be posted to Commerce Headquarters. If a document fails, POS users can make corrections to it and then try again to process it to Commerce Headquarters.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisite-add-inbound-operation-to-the-pos-screen-layout" sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="79">Prerequisite: Add Inbound operation to the POS screen layout</h2>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="81">Before your organization can use the inbound operation functionality, it must configure the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="81">Inbound operation</strong> POS operation on one or more of your <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/retail/pos-screen-layouts" sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="81">POS screen layouts</a>. Before you deploy the new operation in a production environment, make sure that you thoroughly test it and train your users to use it.</p>
<h2 id="overview" sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="83">Overview</h2>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="85">The inbound operation lets POS users perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="87">
<li sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="87">Receive inventory into store stock from either confirmed purchase order documents or shipped transfer order documents.</li>
<li sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="88">View information about historical inventory receipts for a period of seven days after the document has been fully received.</li>
<li sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="89">Create new inbound transfer order requests.</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="91">When the inbound operation is started from the POS application, a list page view appears. This view shows open purchase order and transfer order documents that have inventory lines that are scheduled to be received by the current store. To find and select a specific document, users can scroll the list or use the search feature.</p>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="93">The inbound inventory document list has three tabs:</p>
<ul sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="95">
<li sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="95"><strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="95">Active</strong> – This tab shows documents that are fully or partially open, and that contain lines or quantities on lines that must still be received.</li>
<li sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="96"><strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="96">Draft</strong> – This tab shows new inbound transfer order requests that the store has created. However, the documents have only been saved locally. They haven't yet been submitted to Commerce Headquarters for processing.</li>
<li sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="97"><strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="97">Complete</strong> – This tab shows a list of purchase order or transfer order documents that the store has fully received during the last seven days. This tab is for informational purposes only. All the information about the documents is read-only data for the store.</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="99">When you view documents on any of the tabs, the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="99">Status</strong> field can help you understand the stage that the document is in.</p>
<ul sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="101">
<li sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="101"><strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="101">Draft</strong> – The transfer order document has only been saved locally to the store's channel database.

<li sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="102"><strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="102">Requested</strong> – The purchase order or transfer order has been created in Commerce Headquarters, and is fully open.

<li sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="103"><strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="103">Partially shipped</strong> – The transfer order document has one or more lines or partial line quantities that have been posted as shipped by the outbound warehouse.

<li sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="105"><strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="105">Partially received</strong> – Some of the lines or line quantities on the purchase order or transfer order document have been received by the store, but some lines remain open.</li>
<li sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="106"><strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="106">Fully received</strong> – All lines and quantities on the purchase order or transfer order document have been fully received.

<li sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="109"><strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="109">Processing in HQ</strong> – The document was submitted to Commerce Headquarters from the POS application, but it hasn't yet been successfully posted to Commerce Headquarters. The document is going through the asynchronous document posting process. After the document is successfully posted to Commerce Headquarters, its status should be updated to <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="109">Fully received</strong> or <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="109">Partially received</strong>.</li>
<li sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="110"><strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="110">Processing failed</strong> – The document was posted to Commerce Headquarters and rejected. The <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="110">Details</strong> pane shows the reason for the posting failure. The document must be edited to fix data issues, and then it must be resubmitted to Commerce Headquarters for processing.</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="112">When you select a document line in the list, a <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="112">Details</strong> pane appears. This pane shows additional information about the document, such as shipment and date information. A progress bar shows how many items must still be processed. If the document wasn't successfully processed to Commerce Headquarters, the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="112">Details</strong> pane also shows error messages that are related to the failure.</p>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="114">In the document list page view, you can select <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="114">Order details</strong> on the app bar to view the document details. You can also activate receipt processing on eligible document lines.</p>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="116">In the document list page view, you can also create a new inbound transfer order request for a store. The documents remain in <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="116">Draft</strong> status, and they can be adjusted or deleted until they are submitted to Commerce Headquarters for processing. After they are submitted to Commerce Headquarters, the transfer order lines can no longer be changed from the POS application.</p>
<h2 id="receiving-process" sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="118">Receiving process</h2>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="120">After you select a purchase order or transfer order document on the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="120">Active</strong> tab, you can select <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="120">Order details</strong> to begin the receiving process.</p>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="122">By default, the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="122">Receiving now</strong> view is shown. This view is optimized for bar code scanning. It can be used to build a list of the items that have been scanned, so that those items can be received. To begin the receiving process, you can start to scan item bar codes.</p>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="124">As item bar codes are scanned in the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="124">Receiving now</strong> view, the application validates the items against the selected purchase or transfer order document, to make sure that each scanned item matches a valid item on the document. In the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="124">Receiving now</strong> view, each scan of a bar code is assumed to represent the receipt of a quantity of one unit, unless a quantity is embedded in the bar code. You can repeatedly scan bar codes in this view to build a list of all the items and quantities for the receipt.</p>
<h3 id="example-scenario" sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="126">Example scenario</h3>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="128">A user receives a purchase order that contains 10 units of bar code 5657900266. The user can scan that bar code 10 times to update the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="128">Receiving now</strong> field by one unit per scan. When the user has completed the scans, the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="128">Receiving now</strong> field for the item's line will show that a quantity of 10 was received.</p>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="130">Alternatively, in a scenario where the item quantity is large, the user might prefer to manually enter the quantity instead of scanning the bar code for each item that is received. In this case, the user can scan the bar code one time to add the item to the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="130">Receiving now</strong> list. The user can then select the associated line in the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="130">Receiving now</strong> view and then, in the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="130">Details</strong> pane that appears on the right side of the page, update the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="130">Receiving quantity</strong> field for the item.</p>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="132">Although the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="132">Receiving now</strong> view is optimized for bar code scanning, users can also select <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="132">Receive product</strong> on the app bar, and then enter the item ID or bar code data through a dialog box. After the item that was entered is validated, the user is prompted to enter the receipt quantity.</p>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="134">The <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="134">Receiving now</strong> view provides a focused way for users to see which products they are receiving. Alternatively, the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="134">Full order list</strong> view can be used. This view shows the whole list of document lines for the selected purchase or transfer order document. Users can manually select lines manually in the list and then, in the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="134">Details</strong> pane, update the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="134">Receiving quantity</strong> field for the selected line. In the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="134">Full order list</strong> view, users can scan bar codes, or they can use the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="134">Receive product</strong> function to enter the item ID or bar code, and data about the received quantity, without first having to select the matching item line in the list.</p>
<h3 id="over-receiving-validations" sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="136">Over-receiving validations</h3>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="138">Validations occur during the receiving process for the document lines. They include validations for over-delivery. If a user tries to receive more inventory than was ordered on a purchase order, but either over-delivery isn't configured or the amount that is received exceeds the over-delivery tolerance that is configured for the purchase order line, the user receives an error and isn't allowed to receive the excess quantity.</p>

<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="144">You can close the remaining quantity on an inbound purchase order during the receiving process if the shipper has confirmed that they can’t ship the full quantity that was requested. To do so, the company must be configured to allow underdelivery of purchase orders. Additionally, an underdelivery tolerance percentage must be defined for the purchase order line.</p>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="146">To configure the company to allow underdelivery of purchase orders, in Commerce headquarters, go to <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="146">Procurement and sourcing</strong> &gt; <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="146">Setup</strong> &gt; <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="146">Procurement and sourcing parameters</strong>.

<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="148">Underdelivery tolerance percentages for a purchase order line can be predefined on products as part of the product configurations in Commerce headquarters. Alternatively, they can be set or overwritten on a specific purchase order in Commerce headquarters.</p>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="150">After an organization completes the purchase order underdelivery configurations, POS users will see a new <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="150">Close remaining quantity</strong> option in the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="150">Details</strong> pane when an inbound purchase order line is selected in the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="150">Inbound inventory</strong> operation. If the user closes the remaining quantity, POS performs a validation to verify whether the quantity being closed is within the underdelivery tolerance percentage defined on the purchase order line. If the underdelivery tolerance is exceeded, an error message is displayed and the user won’t be able to close the remaining quantity until the previously received quantity plus the <strong sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="150">Receiving now</strong> quantity meets or exceeds the minimal quantity that needs to be received based on the underdelivery tolerance percentage.</p>

<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="156">If the items that are being received are location-controlled, users can select the location where they want to receive the items during the receiving process. We recommend that you configure a default receiving location for your store warehouse, to make this process more efficient. Even if a default location is configured, users can override the receiving location on selected lines as they require.</p>

<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="168">This feature only works for purchase order receiving. It's not possible to receive items against transfer orders when the items weren't previously ordered and shipped from the outbound warehouse.</p>

To enable change management, all changes to a purchase order must first be approved before receiving is allowed. Because this process allows a receiver to add new lines to the purchase order, receiving will fail if the change management workflow is enabled. If change management is enabled for all purchase orders or for the vendor linked to the purchase order actively being received in POS, the user can't add new products to the purchase order during receiving in POS.</p>
<p sourcefile="commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="172">The functionality that enables adding lines can't be used as a workaround for receiving additional quantities of products already on the purchase order.
