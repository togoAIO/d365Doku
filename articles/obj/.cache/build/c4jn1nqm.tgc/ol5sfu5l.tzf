<li>If <strong>Generate salary</strong> is selected, but <strong>Generate earnings from schedule</strong> Isn't selected, the following information applies:
<ul>
<li>A default earning code is required.</li>
<li>The worker is paid the standard position salary amount for each pay period, and a single line is included on the earnings statement. This line has the date of the last day in the pay period.
<blockquote>[!NOTE] If earnings statement lines were entered manually before the earnings were generated, the salary might be split across multiple lines. The total of the manually entered lines and the single generated line is always the standard salary amount.</blockquote>

<h2 id="assigning-default-tax-regions" sourcefile="fin-ops-core/fin-ops/hr/localizations/noam-usa-worker-position-payroll-tasks.md" sourcestartlinenumber="142">Assigning default tax regions</h2>
<p sourcefile="fin-ops-core/fin-ops/hr/localizations/noam-usa-worker-position-payroll-tasks.md" sourcestartlinenumber="144">Tax regions are geographic areas where a specific set of payroll taxes applies. Tax regions generally correspond to the cities or towns where your workers reside or work. A worker tax region is a tax region that has been assigned to a specific worker. A default tax region is required for each position that a worker holds. A default tax region is a worker tax region that is used to generate earnings for a specific position that a worker holds. Therefore, if you don't assign a default tax region to the worker's tax position, earnings can't be generated for the position. In this case, to pay the worker, you must manually enter the earnings and then manually enter the tax region on each earning statement line.</p>
<p sourcefile="fin-ops-core/fin-ops/hr/localizations/noam-usa-worker-position-payroll-tasks.md" sourcestartlinenumber="146">If a worker's position requires different tax regions at different times, you must still select a single default tax region for the position. You can then change the tax region on individual earning statement lines after you generate earnings for the position.</p>
<div class="NOTE" sourcefile="fin-ops-core/fin-ops/hr/localizations/noam-usa-worker-position-payroll-tasks.md" sourcestartlinenumber="148">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p sourcefile="fin-ops-core/fin-ops/hr/localizations/noam-usa-worker-position-payroll-tasks.md" sourcestartlinenumber="149">Although the default tax region is used to generate earnings for a position, it's assigned to the worker who holds the position, not to the position itself. If the position is later reassigned to a different worker, a default tax region must be assigned to the new worker who holds the position. The default tax region isn't reassigned to the new worker when the position is reassigned.</p>
<p sourcefile="fin-ops-core/fin-ops/hr/localizations/noam-usa-worker-position-payroll-tasks.md" sourcestartlinenumber="151">If the worker tax region that should be specified for the position isn't included in the list, close this page, and use the <strong sourcefile="fin-ops-core/fin-ops/hr/localizations/noam-usa-worker-position-payroll-tasks.md" sourcestartlinenumber="151">Worker tax region</strong> page to assign the tax region to the worker.

<p sourcefile="fin-ops-core/fin-ops/hr/localizations/noam-usa-worker-position-payroll-tasks.md" sourcestartlinenumber="155">You can manage a worker's tax options, such as filing status and total allowances, on the <strong sourcefile="fin-ops-core/fin-ops/hr/localizations/noam-usa-worker-position-payroll-tasks.md" sourcestartlinenumber="155">Worker tax codes</strong> page. You don't have to create or assign the worker tax codes, because the codes are automatically created and assigned to the worker when you create worker tax regions. At first, all parameters for worker tax codes are set to their default values. We recommend that you review the worker tax codes for each worker to make sure that they're accurate. For more information, see <a href="noam-usa-tax-information-tasks.html" sourcefile="fin-ops-core/fin-ops/hr/localizations/noam-usa-worker-position-payroll-tasks.md" sourcestartlinenumber="155">Set up taxes, tax regions, tax codes, and tax groups</a>. You must first create a list or spreadsheet that contains the values of the tax options for all the tax codes that are assigned to each worker whose tax codes you're setting up.

In this case, the new version of the tax code parameter is stamped with the date but not the time. Therefore, the first change that is made during a given day creates a new version of the parameter. If you change the value later during the same day, the new change overwrites the previous change but doesn't create a new version of the parameter. Only the last change is saved in the date-effective version.</li>

<td>The order that deductions and contributions for the selected benefit are calculated in, relative to other benefits. The deductions and contributions for the benefit that has the lowest calculation priority are calculated first. The lowest calculation priority is 0 (zero). When multiple benefits have the same number, the calculations for those benefits are done in alphabetical order. The calculation order is important when the result of the calculation for one benefit is used in the calculation for another benefit. This behavior is especially likely for garnishments and tax levies. Your legal advisors should help you determine the correct calculation priority for all benefits.</td>

<td>Deduction priority</td>
<td>The order that deductions for the selected benefit are made in, relative to other deductions. The deduction for the benefit that has the lowest deduction priority is made first. The lowest deduction priority is 1. When multiple benefits have the same number, the deductions for those benefits are made in alphabetical order.

<td>Rate source, Basis, Deduction</td>
<td>Together, the basis option and the deduction amount are used to calculate the amount of the payroll deduction for the benefit. The default values for these fields are set in the <strong>Basis</strong> and <strong>Amount or rate</strong> fields on the <strong>Benefits</strong> page. The <strong>Rate source</strong> field determines whether these fields are changed to match the default values when the benefit rates are updated from the benefit.
<ul>
<li>If you select <strong>Benefit</strong>, the deduction amount and basis for the worker are updated automatically when you click <strong>Update benefit rates</strong> on the <strong>Benefits</strong> page.</li>
<li>If you select <strong>Custom</strong>, the deduction amount and basis for the worker aren't changed when you click <strong>Update benefit rates</strong> on the <strong>Benefits</strong> page. Select this option when the contribution for a worker is specific to that worker. For example, after a rate change, contribution amounts might be grandfathered in for some workers.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>[!NOTE] For contributions, the default value of the <strong>Rate source</strong> field is <strong>Benefit</strong>.</blockquote>
