<p sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">This topic describes the Asset leasing capability and walks through the steps for creating an asset lease and view information for those leases. The topic also defines the terminology used in the user interface and the documentation. Asset leasing is an advanced capability for managing, tracking, and automating financial transactions for leased assets in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. Asset leasing complies with International accounting standards (IFRS 16) and US GAAP standards (ASC 842). Asset leasing captures and processes information about the leases and helps generate journal entries throughout the lifecycle of the lease, from initial recognition, monthly journal entries, to impairment and termination of the lease. Asset leasing integrates seamlessly with other components of Dynamics 365 Finance, including Fixed assets, Accounts payable, and General ledger.</p>
<p sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">For more information regarding accounting standards, refer to the standard documentation for IFRS 16 and US GAAP ASC 842.</p>

<p sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">The following diagram shows the main elements of the business process for leases.</p>
<p sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="43"><a href="media/overview-01.png" sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="43"><img src="media/overview-01.png" sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="43" alt="Asset leasing elements"></a></p>
<p sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="45">A leased asset contains the following main components:</p>
<ul sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="47">
<li sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="47"><p sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="47"><strong sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="47">Lease agreement</strong> - The lessor owns the asset and agrees with the lessee to lease an asset for specific period in exchange for periodic lease payments. In addition to the legal contract between the lessor and lessee, the lease agreement captures management decisions such as the likelihood of exercising a renewal option and transfer of ownership.</p>
</li>
<li sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="49"><p sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="49"><strong sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="49">Lease calculation and classification per accounting standard</strong> - The lease calculation and classification identify the accounting standard that will be applied in the initial and subsequent measurement, as well as the classification test that determines what the lease type will be. A lease can be a finance lease, an operating lease, a short-term lease, or a low-value lease. The system also calculates the present value of future minimum lease payments for the purpose of valuation and classification.</p>
</li>
<li sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="51"><p sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="51"><strong sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="51">Lease transactions</strong> - Asset leasing supports the initial recognition of the right-of-use asset for leases on the balance sheet, as well as subsequent measurement for either on-balance sheet leases or off-balance sheet leases. The initial recognition transaction measures the present value of future minimum lease payments. This data is used to determine the value of the initial right-of-use asset and lease liability, which affect the organization's balance sheet. The subsequent measurement of monthly lease transactions involves the accumulation of interest on the lease liability, which increases the lease liability. It also measures the accrual of lease payments that decrease the lease liability, and that will subsequently be paid to the lessor. The measurement also includes the amortization of the right-of-use asset.</p>
<p sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="53">For off-balance sheet leases, the system calculates the straight-line lease expense over whichever is less: the economic life of the asset, or the lease term. Lease adjustments measure contract modifications such as a lease extension or expansion, and the impairment transaction that uses the right-of-use asset for non-recoverable costs.</p>
<p sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="55">Asset leasing integrates with General ledger to ensure that all posted lease transactions update your chart of accounts. Asset leasing integrates with Accounts payable to track lessor invoices in Accounts payable and take future payments from there. The integration with Fixed assets lets you track leases in the fixed assets register and post right-of-use assets transactions, including the initial recognition, depreciation, and impairment of the asset, from within Fixed assets.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="58">Asset leasing maps lease information, payment schedules, starting and ending dates, and the payment frequency. It also automates calculations for present value, monthly lease payments, interest, and lease amortization. The system performs lease classification tests, depending on the configuration. The system also creates and posts the corresponding lease transactions, which are based on the framework defined by the accounting standard you’re following.</p>

If a fixed asset is associated with the lease, the initial recognition entry will be reflected as a fixed asset acquisition. In this scenario, you must define a fixed assets posting profile  to post to the right-of-use asset account.</p>

<p sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="143">The interest for a lease is recognized by calculating interest for the lease’s beginning balance, period lease payment, interest borrowing rate, and compound interval periods per year.

The transaction also includes a debit entry to the interest expense account, which is reflected on the profit and loss statement for finance leases, and to the lease expense account for operating leases.</p>

<p sourcefile="finance/asset-leasing/asset-leasing-quick-start.md" sourcestartlinenumber="159">The right-of-use asset is depreciated over whichever is less - the asset useful life or the lease term. The method for calculating depreciation for US GAAP (ASC 842) is based on the difference between the straight-line lease expense and the interest amount. Interest on finance leases is calculated using a standard straight-line method. The lease depreciation affects the profit and loss statement by debiting interest expense. The balance sheet is affected by crediting accumulated right-of-use asset account for finance leases. For operating leases, the depreciation is crediting the lease expense account. If the lease is linked to a fixed asset, the depreciation transactions will be executed from fixed assets module only.</p>
