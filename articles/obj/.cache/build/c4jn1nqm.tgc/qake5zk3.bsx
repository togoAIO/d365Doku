<p sourcefile="supply-chain/cost-management/fifo-physical-value-marking.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">First in, First out (FIFO) is an inventory model in which the first acquired receipts are issued first. Financially updated issues from inventory are settled against the first financially updated receipts into inventory, based on the financial date of the inventory transaction.</p>
<p sourcefile="supply-chain/cost-management/fifo-physical-value-marking.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">When you use FIFO, you don’t have to use the FIFO rule. Instead, you can mark inventory transactions so that a specific item receipt is settled against a specific issue. We recommend a periodic inventory closing when you use the FIFO inventory model. The following examples show the effect of using FIFO in three configurations:</p>

<p sourcefile="supply-chain/cost-management/fifo-physical-value-marking.md" sourcestartlinenumber="110">Marking is a process that lets you link, or mark, an issue transaction to a receipt transaction. Marking can occur either before or after a transaction is posted. You can use marking when you want to be sure of the exact cost of inventory when the transaction is posted or the inventory close is performed. For example, the Customer Service department accepted a rush order from an important customer. Because this order is a rush order, you must pay more for this item in order to fulfill your customer’s request. You must make sure that the cost of this inventory item is reflected in the margin, or cost of goods sold (COGS), for this sales order invoice. When the purchase order is posted, the inventory is received at a cost of USD 120.00. If this sales order document is marked to the purchase order before the packing slip or invoice is posted, the COGS will be USD 120.00, not the current running average cost for the item. If the sales order packing slip or invoice is posted before the marking occurs, the COGS will be posted at the running average cost price. Before inventory close is performed, these two transactions can still be marked to each other. When a receipt transaction matches an issue transaction, the valuation method that is defined in the item model group is disregarded, and the system settles these transactions to each other. You can mark an issue transaction to a receipt before the transaction is posted. You can do this from a sales order line on the <strong sourcefile="supply-chain/cost-management/fifo-physical-value-marking.md" sourcestartlinenumber="110">Sales order details</strong> page. You can view the open receipt transactions on the <strong sourcefile="supply-chain/cost-management/fifo-physical-value-marking.md" sourcestartlinenumber="110">Marking</strong> page. You can also mark an issue transaction to a receipt after the transaction is posted. You can match or mark an issue transaction for an open receipt transaction for an inventoried item from a posted inventory adjustment journal. The illustration that follows shows these transactions:</p>
