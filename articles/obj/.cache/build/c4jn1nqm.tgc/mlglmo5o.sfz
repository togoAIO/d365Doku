<h1 id="sped-reinf-tax-statement-brazil">SPED-Reinf tax statement (Brazil)</h1>


<p>The SPED-Reinf is a new tax statement report that gathers information about withholding tax and other tax information that is of interest from the Brazilian Internal Revenue Service (RFB) and Social Security. (In Brazilian Portuguese, Reinf stands for &quot;Retenções e Outras Informações Fiscais.&quot;) The statement consists of a set of events that must be delivered, in specific layouts, through
the environment of the public digital bookkeeping system (SPED). Additionally, they must be delivered by using a valid digital certificate that is issued by an entity that is accredited by the Brazilian Public Key Infrastructure (ICP-Brasil). The statement will be considered valid after receipt is confirmed and the contents of the files are validated.</p>
<p>The SPED-Reinf was created to assess federal taxes that are withheld, for Social Security and income taxes purposes, for activities that aren't related to labor. Examples of these activities include fiscal documents, payments, and other events.</p>
<p>Microsoft Dynamics supports the generation of SPED-Reinf events through the <strong>Fiscal books</strong> module and the SII reporting register framework. Users can exchange XML messages for every event that is required by the tax authority.</p>

<p><strong>SPED-Reinf setup</strong></p>
<p>This section describes the configuration that is required.</p>
<h3 id="set-up-electronic-messages-functionality"><strong>Set up Electronic messages functionality</strong></h3>
<p>Electronic messages functionality is new in Dynamics 365 Finance. It lets you maintain and track various processes for electronic messages when there is an exchange of information between Finance and tax authority web services.</p>
<p>Before you issue SPED-Reinf events to government website, use the predefined configuration that Microsoft has prepared to meet SPED-Reinf requirements. This configuration is delivered as a data entity. After it's imported into Finance, users will able to generate, validate, and deliver all events that are described in the SPED-Reinf scope.</p>
<h4 id="import-the-configuration-from-the-data-entity">Import the configuration from the data entity</h4>
<p>To set up Electronic messages functionality for SPED-Reinf event communications, use the predefined configuration that is available in LCS.</p>

<p><img src="media/bra-execution-summary-page.png" alt="Execution summary page"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="structure-of-electronic-messages">Structure of electronic messages</h4>
<p>Every event that is created, delivered, and received is represented by a message and a message item.</p>
<p><img src="media/bra-electronic-messages-structure.png" alt="Electronic messages structure"></p>
<p>The message item is represented by the XML event message, and it also includes the following additional information that is stored in the message or updated in Microsoft Dynamics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The CNPJ of the fiscal establishment (full number)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The root CNPJ</p>
</li>
<li><p>The booking period</p>
</li>
<li><p>The start date of the period that the message is valid for</p>
</li>
<li><p>The receipt protocol number</p>
</li>
<li><p>A value that indicates whether the message is registered in Microsoft Dynamics</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find this configuration at <strong>Tax &gt; Setup &gt; Electronic messages &gt; Additional fields</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="media/bra-electronic-messaging-additional-fields.png" alt="Electronic messages additional fields"></p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Don't remove this configuration. This configuration is included in the package.</p>
</div>
<p>The message item types are classified by the type of event at <strong>Tax &gt; Setup &gt; Electronic messages &gt; Message item types</strong>.</p>

<p>Go to <strong>Tax &gt; Setup &gt; Parameters &gt; General ledger parameters</strong>, and then, on the <strong>Number sequences</strong> tab, select <strong>Message</strong> and <strong>Message item</strong> to set up the sequence number for message items.</p>
<p><img src="media/bra-electronic-messages-number-sequences.png" alt="Electronic messages number sequences"></p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The number sequence must be defined as non-continuous.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="certificates">Certificates</h4>
<p>Trusted certificates must be configured and used by Microsoft Dynamics, because the SPED-Reinf should always be signed by an e-CNPJ certificate that is authorized by the ICP-Brazil entity, regardless of any other signatures. This e-CNPJ certificate should match the first eight digits of the root fiscal establishment's CNPJ, because the report is issued by the root fiscal establishment and the related fiscal establishments.</p>
<p>In Finance, you must register the Key Vault certificate in Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>For information about how to set up a Key Vault client, see <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4040305">Setting up Azure Key Vault Client</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to <strong>System administration &gt; Setup &gt; Key Vault parameters</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enter the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Key Vault URL</p>
</li>
<li><p>Key Vault client</p>
</li>
<li><p>Key Vault secret key</p>
</li>
<li><p>Key vault secret ID</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After registration, associate the certificate in the setup parameters for the <strong>Report generation</strong> action, as described in the next section.</p>
<h4 id="setup-parameters">Setup parameters</h4>
<p>Every time that a message is created, prepared, validated, delivered, or received, the related action must be identified through a X++ class at <strong>Tax &gt; Setup &gt; Electronic messages &gt; Executable class settings</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Preparation items (Preparacao dos eventos) –</strong> This action is used to create and prepare the XML message. It requests additional parameters, such as <strong>Booking date</strong>, <strong>CNPJ</strong>, and <strong>CNPJ root</strong>, because the events are generated based on this information.</p>
<p><img src="media/bra-preparation-items.png" alt="Preparation items"></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Process response (Processo de reposta)</strong> – This action is used to update the delivered message when it's approved by the government by using a protocol number. Additionally, the message is updated as registered on the     government website.</p>

</div>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Area:</strong> Fiscal books</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Reference:</strong> SPED-Reinf event ID</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SPED-Reinf events</strong></p>
<p>All the information that the SPED-Reinf provides about taxes and contributions in a given assessment period is known as a <em>movement</em>. Therefore, every movement can contain one or more events.</p>
<p>To close the transmission of periodic events for a given movement in a specific assessment period, you must send event R-2099, &quot;Closure of periodic event.&quot; After the closure event is processed and validated, it's accepted. Acceptance of the closure event finalizes the sum of the calculation bases that are included in the movement. The tax credit can then be calculated, and the DARF can be
generated to collect taxes and contributions that are owed.</p>
<p>If a correction or new events must be sent for a movement that has already been closed, you must reopen the movement by sending event R-2098, &quot;Reopening of periodic event.&quot; After a movement is reopened, you must send a new closing event.</p>
<p><strong>When there is no movement in the assessment period</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;no movement&quot; situation for a taxpayer occurs only when there is no information to send to the periodic event group from event R-2010 to event R-2070. In this case, event R-2099, &quot;Closure of periodic event,&quot; which provides the information for closure, declares the non-occurrence of transactions in the first assessment period of the year that this situation occurs in. If the &quot;no movement&quot; situation persists in the following years, the taxpayer must repeat this procedure in January of each year.</p>
<p><strong>Receiving protocol</strong></p>
<p>The receiving protocol confirms that the information that was sent was successfully delivered and validated to the SPED-Reinf environment. The receiving protocol is the starting point for correcting or deleting a given event, if correction and deletion are allowed.</p>
<p>Every event that is transmitted has a receiving protocol. To correct an event, you must enter the number of the event's receiving protocol.</p>
<p>The amount of time that receiving protocols are kept in the government database isn't defined. Therefore, as a precaution, it's important that the taxpayer retain them, because they provide proof that the ancillary tax obligation has been delivered and met.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The delivery protocol is transient information that provides proof that the event has been transmitted, and that the appropriate validation will be processed. It doesn't demonstrate compliance with the ancillary obligation.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Amendment and correction</strong></p>
<p>The procedure for amending information that is sent to the SPED-Reinf occurs only in events R-1000, &quot;Taxpayer information,&quot; and R-1070, &quot;Administrative and
lawsuits table.&quot;</p>
<p>In all other cases where the information that was sent must be amended, the procedure for correction or deletion must be used.</p>
<p><strong>Deletion events</strong></p>
<p>To exclude events that were approved by the tax authority but incorrectly delivered, you must send event R-9000, &quot;Deletion event.&quot; In this event, you must identify the event to delete by filling in the <strong>Event Type</strong> tag (<strong>TpEvento</strong>). You must also fill in <strong>Event Receipt Number</strong> (<strong>NRRECEVT</strong>), which specifies the receipt protocol number of the file that was sent and must be deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Digital signature</strong></p>
<p>The digital certificate that is used in the SPED-Reinf must be issued by a certification authority that is accredited by ICP-Brasil.</p>
<p>The digital certificate must belong to the &quot;A&quot; series. Certificates can belong to two series: the &quot;A&quot; series and the &quot;S&quot; series. The &quot;A&quot; series includes the digital signature certificates that are used for web identity confirmation on emails, virtual private networks (VPNs), and electronic documents, with verification of the integrity of its information. The &quot;S&quot; series includes the confidentiality certificates that are used in the encoding of documents, databases, messages, and other sensitive electronic information.</p>
<p>The digital certificate must be of the &quot;A1&quot; or &quot;A3&quot; type. Digital certificates of the &quot;A1&quot; type are stored on the computer that they are used from. Digital certificates of the &quot;A3&quot; type are stored in a tamper-resistant portable device that contains a chip that can do the digital signing. Examples of these devices include smart cards and tokens. These devices are reasonably secure, because every operation is done by the chip on the device, and there is no external access to the private key of the digital certificate.</p>
<p>The digital certificates are required at two moments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>For delivery actions</strong>: Before the request for delivery to the SPED-Reinf is started, the requestor's digital certificate is used to help guarantee the safety of the information traffic on the internet. For the digital certificate to be accepted as a transmitter function, it must be of the e-CNPJ type.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>For document signing</strong>: The events can be generated by any fiscal establishment of the legal entity or its proxy. However, the digital subscriber of those events must belong to the main fiscal establishment (headquarters), its legal representative, or an attorney that is granted by means of electronic and non-electronic proxy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The digital certificates that are used to sign the events that are sent to the SPED-Reinf must be enabled for the digital signature function in accordance with the certificate policy.</p>
<p>The events in the SPED-Reinf must be transmitted by using a valid digital certificate. However, an exception is made for micro and small businesses (ME and EPP) that meet the Simple Nacional criteria and have seven or fewer employees. These businesses can transmit their events by using an access code.</p>
<h3 id="general-process">General process</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Use an electronic message to create, validate, and deliver the event or batch of events through electronic message items.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The tax authority web service receives the batch and validates its contents.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The web service returns the result of processing. If the events or batch of events is successfully received, a receiving protocol is returned. Otherwise, an error message is returned. In that case, the taxpayer can resolve the errors and resubmit the event through a new batch.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="event-r-1000-taxpayer-information">Event R-1000, &quot;Taxpayer information&quot;</h3>
<p>Event R-1000 is used to delivery information about the company. This event must be delivered only one time to register the information on the government site. However, after this initial registration of information, it can be delivered as many times as required for maintenance actions such as updates and deletions of data.</p>
<p>Therefore, whenever any taxpayer attribute or the valid date of information that was provided earlier must be changed, event R-1000 must be delivered again. When it's redelivered, the correct group of tags for the desired action must be specified.</p>
<p>Because communications can fail for technical reasons, such as a time-out or an internet shortage, the tax accountant must be able to resubmit the event. Additionally, because validation of the file by the web service can fail, the tax accountant must be able to view the details and fix the related errors. After the file is validated, the receiving protocol that is returned by the web service must be saved, and the tax accountant must be able to view its details, such as the number and time stamp.</p>

<h3 id="event-r-1070-administrative-and-judicial-process">Event R-1070, &quot;Administrative and judicial process&quot;</h3>
<p>Event R-1070 is used to report information about the administrative and lawsuits process to tax authority system.</p>
<p>The administrative and lawsuits process can be started by either the taxpayer or by the worker when the amounts in the social security are disputed. The proceedings (either judicial or administrative) are carried out by the court. After the judge reaches a final decision, they have the power to suspend (or not) the amounts that were retained.</p>
<p>The purpose of this event is to communicate the existence of proceedings of this type to the SPED-Reinf database. After the proceedings have a final court decision that suspends the eligibility of withholding amounts, the event refers to that decision to explain why the amounts have been reported as suspended in the periodic events.</p>
<p>Besides the typical information that identifies the taxpayer and the event, event R-1070 contains the following groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identifier of the process or proceedings</p>
</li>
<li><p>Suspension information</p>
</li>
<li><p>Complementary information about the proceedings</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Before event R-1070 can be delivered, you must create the related process and
include all related information.</p>

<h3 id="event-r-2010-acquired-services">Event R-2010, &quot;Acquired services&quot;</h3>
<p>Periodic event R-2010 is used to report, to the tax authority system, information about the withholding amounts for social security that are present in service fiscal documents that were received by the fiscal establishment. This event has no other purpose but to report those fiscal documents to the government.</p>
<p>This event must be sent until the fifteenth day of the next month. Because it's a periodic event, we don't recommend that you send the event just one time, near the due date. Instead, you should send it regularly and frequently during the period.</p>
<p>Additionally, generation of this event requires the adoption of new semantics for handling events in fiscal books. The new semantics are decoupled from a tax assessment but are still in the context of the booking period. After every fiscal document in the <strong>Fiscal books</strong> module is in the context of a booking period, event R-2010 must also be generated by booking period.</p>
<p>Only service and retained INSS tax type must be selected to generate this event in the booking period.</p>
<p><strong>Main criteria</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The fiscal documents are booked and synced in the related period and fiscal establishment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The fiscal documents have a status of <strong>Approved</strong> or <strong>Canceled</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The fiscal document model is <strong>SE</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The tax type is <strong>INSS</strong>, and it's retained (the <strong>Retained tax/to recuperate</strong> check box is selected).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="media/bra-brazilian-taxes.png" alt="Brazilian taxes"></p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Never use the <strong>INSS-CPRB</strong> tax type.</p>
</div>
<p>The report is grouped by a <strong>Type of service code</strong> value (table 06 from the SPED-Reinf documentation). Therefore, you must modify the posting of service fiscal documents to enable the capture of this information. Otherwise, the event can't be generated.</p>
<p>The event sends four types of amounts to the government database:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Withholding</strong> – The calculated retained INSS tax type that is linked to the fiscal document line.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Additional withholding</strong> – A variation of the INSS tax type that is linked to the fiscal document line.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Suspended withholding</strong> – The amount of the suspended retained INSS tax type.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Suspended additional withholding</strong> – The suspended amount on the variation of the INSS tax type that is linked to the fiscal document line.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever a suspension of amounts occurs, the associated administrative or lawsuits process must be specified in the event to support (or explain) the reasons for the suspension. This information must be manually entered in the <strong>Amount of withholding</strong> and <strong>Additional amount of withholding</strong> fields on the <strong>Administration and judicial process</strong> page that is described in the previous section.</p>
<p>Event R-2010 uses the concept of closing. After this event is closed, the web service will refuse any new entries or modifications for it, unless it's manually reopened.</p>
<div class="NOTE">

<p>Follow the steps that are described for event R-1000 to insert, update, or cancel the related event.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="event-r-2020-provided-services">Event R-2020, &quot;Provided services&quot;</h3>
<p>Periodic event R-2020 is used to report, to the tax authority system, information about the withholdings amounts for social security that are present in service fiscal documents that were issued by the fiscal establishments of a fiscal organization.</p>
<p>This event works like event R-2010, but you must consider customer accounts and fiscal document model SE (outgoing) that is issued by the fiscal establishment.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Follow the steps that are described for event R-1000 to insert, update, or cancel the related event.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="event-r-2060-inss-cprb">Event R-2060, &quot;INSS CPRB&quot;</h3>
<p>Periodic event R-2060 is used to send information about the tax assessment of the withholding for social security to the SPED-Reinf when the fiscal organization has chosen to calculate the social security based on the gross revenue instead of the payroll.</p>
<p>Therefore, before you generate the event, you must do the tax assessment by fiscal organization in the <strong>Fiscal books</strong> module. When this option is established in the SPED-Reinf parameters, users can create the tax assessment for INSS-CPRB, and taxes are automatically calculated based on the criteria that are defined in the Fiscal books parameters.</p>
<p>Microsoft Dynamics will pick up all fiscal documents that are booked in the related period and that represents revenue, and it will apply the tax rate to the base amount. The tax rate that is applied can vary, depending on the product or service that generated the revenue. The result will be the amount of CPRB.</p>
<p>For this purpose, a new Brazilian tax type, <strong>INSS-CPRB</strong>, was created. This tax type is used only in the generation of the INSS-CPRB tax assessment.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Don't use the <strong>INSS-CPRB</strong> tax type for other purposes.</p>
</div>
<p>Because the INSS-CPRB tax assessment is a type of tax assessment, adjustments might become necessary. These adjustments must be manually entered as either additions or reductions.</p>
<p>Finally, the tax assessment and the adjustments determine the amount of CPRB that must be paid. However, generation of the payment journal and registration on this payment isn't in the scope of this feature.</p>
<p>Periods for this new tax assessment must be managed in the same way as other tax assessments. In other words, the tax assessment can be created or updated only while it's open. After it's finalized, it can no longer be touched unless it's reopened.</p>
<p>After the tax assessment is created and any required adjustments are made, periodic event R-2060 can be generated.</p>
<p>Event R-2060 includes the totals of the tax assessment and details of the tax calculations by economic activity code, adjustments (additions and reductions, when applicable), and references to administrative and lawsuits processes.</p>
<h4 id="repro-step--setup">Repro step – Setup</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Fiscal books &gt; Setup &gt; Fiscal organization</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Finalize and Reopen</strong></p>
<p>You can finalize or reopen the related INSS-CPRB tax assessment.</p>
<p>When an INSS-CPRB tax assessment is finalized, no modifications to the tax assessment are allowed for that period, unless the tax assessment is reopened. A voucher is created to post the INSS-CPRB tax to collect, and the ledger accounts are defined in the ledger posting for INSS tax at <strong>Tax &gt; Setup &gt; Sales tax &gt; Ledger posting groups</strong>.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>In the current SPED-Reinf architecture that is defined by the government, the process for payment and settlement of the liability that is created by the tax assessment will be reported to another system that is named DCTF web. This system consumes the output from not only the SPED-Reinf but also the other systems, such as eSocial and PER/DCOMP. Therefore, the payment process is currently out of scope and is delivered through another Microsoft Dynamics feature.</p>
</div>
<p>The reopen action is available if event R-2060 has already been closed for the root fiscal establishment, and if the tax assessment is already finalized. The reopen action reverses the previous voucher that was generated by the closing action.</p>
