<p sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/release-product-structure.md" sourcestartlinenumber="33">To ensure that engineering-relevant product data can easily be reused in different legal entities, you can release complete product structures in addition to releasing products together with their engineering versions. Therefore, you can release multilevel bill of materials (BOM) structures together with the parent in a single release action. In this case, the BOM and the lower-level products are also released.</p>
<p sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/release-product-structure.md" sourcestartlinenumber="35">Engineering products are created and maintained by their engineering company in such way that they meet quality requirements as they are designed. Each operational company that manufactures a product needs the same product and underlying BOM. Depending on the production facility, the route might be created locally. In this case, you won't release a route together with the product. For legal entities that will sell the products but won't manufacture them, the BOM might not be required.</p>
<p sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/release-product-structure.md" sourcestartlinenumber="37">To make the process more efficient, all engineering-relevant data can be released to other operational companies at the same time. This data includes the product structure. During the release process, you can choose which part of the product data should be released.</p>
<p sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/release-product-structure.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">For more information about engineering companies and operational companies, see <a href="engineering-org-data-ownership-rules.html" sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/release-product-structure.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">Engineering companies and data ownership rules</a>.</p>
<p sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/release-product-structure.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">Note that you can release both standard products and engineering products together with the release product structure. During this process, the whole product structure will be released, even the BOM and route from the company that the products are being released in.</p>
