<h1 id="get-started-with-planning-optimization">Get started with Planning Optimization</h1>


<p>As <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/supply-chain/get-started/removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates#use-of-built-in-supply-chain-management-master-planning-engine-for-distribution-scenarios">previously announced</a>, Planning Optimization is scheduled to replace the existing built-in master planning engine.</p>
<p>If you currently use the built-in master planning engine, you should start planning your migration to Planning Optimization now. It is important to start the migration process right away because your operations may be impacted when deprecation is enforced. To avoid last-minutes issues when deprecation is enforced, we strongly encourage you to complete the migration before December 1, 2020.</p>
<p>The Planning Optimization functionality doesn't currently support all the features that are available in the planning engine that is built into Supply Chain Management. Therefore, it's important that you evaluate whether the feature set that is currently available in Planning Optimization will meet your requirements. The Planning Optimization functionality isn't currently turned on by default in Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), so you have the opportunity to do your evaluation before the feature is turned on.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>You need to request an exception from migration to Planning Optimization if your master planning process does not include production (master planning generated planned production orders) and you require the built-in master planning engine beyond version 10.0.15. Starting in version 10.0.16, an error will be shown in environments when running built-in master planning without generation of planned production orders. Planning Optimization should be used for all new deployments that do not generate planned production orders during master planning. Owners of existing environments running the built-in master planning engine without generation of Planned production orders, will receive a mail with details about the exception process. We recommend that you work with a partner to evaluate and plan the migration to Planning Optimization.</p>
</div>
<p>Before you turn on Planning Optimization, we strongly recommend that you evaluate the results of the Planning Optimization fit analysis. For more information, see <a href="planning-optimization-fit-analysis.html">Planning Optimization fit analysis</a>.</p>
<h3 id="availability">Availability</h3>
<p>Planning Optimization is currently available in the following Azure geographies: United States, Canada, Europe, United Kingdom, Australia, and Asia Pacific. If you try to install the add-in from another geographic region, then LCS will show a message that this geographic is not supported.</p>
<p>Note that Planning Optimization does not support on-premises deployments of Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.</p>
<h3 id="licensing">Licensing</h3>
<p>If you can run master planning by using your current license, you don't have to buy an additional license to start to use Planning Optimization.</p>
<h3 id="install-the-add-in">Install the add-in</h3>
<p>To use Planning Optimization, install the Planning Optimization Add-in for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. You can access the add-in from your LCS project and turn on the Planning Optimization functionality from the Supply Chain Management user interface (UI).</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The requirement for Planning Optimization is an LCS enabled high-availability environment, tier 2 or higher (not a OneBox environment), with Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management version 10.0.7 or later. If you try to install the add-in on a OneBox environment, the installation will not complete and you will need to cancel the installation.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to LCS, and open the desired environment.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Full details</strong>.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <strong>Environment add-ins</strong> FastTab.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Install a new add-in</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Planning Optimization</strong>.</li>
<li>Follow the installation guide, and agree to the terms and conditions.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Install</strong>.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Environment add-ins</strong> FastTab you should see that Planning Optimization is installing.</li>
<li>After a few minutes <strong>Installing</strong> should change to <strong>Installed</strong> (you may need to refresh the page). When installed, you are ready to activate Planning Optimization in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main purpose of installing the Planning Optimization add-in is to connect the service and the environment. Therefore, you must install the add-in separately on each environment where you will use Planning Optimization, regardless of any code moved between the environments.</p>
<h3 id="planning-optimization-integration">Planning Optimization integration</h3>
<p>To configure whether the Planning Optimization Add-in should be used for master planning, go to <strong>Master planning</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Planning Optimization parameters</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="connection-status">Connection status</h4>
<p>The connection status indicates the current status of the connection between Supply Chain Management and the Planning Optimization service. The following table shows the possible values.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Connection status</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Can Planning Optimization be used?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Connected</td>
<td>A connection has been established between the Planning Optimization service and Supply Chain Management.</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Enabling connection</td>
<td>A request to turn on the connection to the Planning Optimization service is currently in progress.</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Disconnected</td>
<td>There is no connection to the Planning Optimization service. The connection can be turned on from LCS, as described earlier in this topic.</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Disabling connection</td>
<td>A request to turn off the connection to the Planning Optimization service is currently in progress.</td>

<h4 id="the-use-planning-optimization-option">The Use Planning Optimization option</h4>
<p>The setting of the <strong>Use Planning Optimization</strong> option determines which planning engine is used for master planning:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yes</strong> – Planning Optimization is used for master planning.</li>
<li><strong>No</strong> – The built-in Supply Chain Management planning engine is used for master planning.</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>If existing planning batch jobs that were created for the built-in Supply Chain Management planning engine are triggered while the <strong>Use Planning Optimization</strong> option is set to <strong>Yes</strong>, those jobs will fail.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="integration-with-the-setup">Integration with the setup</h3>
<p>If the Planning Optimization is turned on, master planning is done by using the Planning Optimization Add-in. In this case, master planning results and features are affected.</p>
