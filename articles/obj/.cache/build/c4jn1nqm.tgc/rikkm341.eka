<h5>Important</h5>
<p>Some or all of the functionality noted in this topic is available as part of a preview release. The content and the functionality are subject to change. For more information about preview releases, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/fin-and-ops/get-started/one-version">One version service updates FAQ</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="WARNING">
<h5>Warning</h5>
<p>Not all business functionality is fully supported in the public preview when workload scale units are used. Be sure to use only the processes that this topic explicitly describes as supported.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="warehouse-execution-on-scale-units">Warehouse execution on scale units</h2>
<p>This feature enables scale units to run selected processes from the warehouse management capabilities. Cloud scale units run their workloads in the cloud by using dedicated processing capacity in your selected Microsoft Azure region. For edge scale units, you can run some workloads independently on premises, even while the scale units are temporarily disconnected from the cloud.</p>
<p>In this topic, warehouse management executions in a warehouse that is defined as a scale unit are known as a <em>Warehouse execution system</em> (<em>WES</em>).</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>You must have a Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management hub and a scale unit that has been deployed with the warehouse management workload. For more information about the architecture and deployment process, see <a href="cloud-edge-landing-page.html">Cloud and edge scale units for manufacturing and warehouse management workloads</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-wes-workload-works-on-scale-units">How the WES workload works on scale units</h2>
<p>For the processes in the warehouse management workload, the data is synced between the hub and the scale units.</p>
<p>A scale unit can maintain only the data that it owns. The data ownership concept for scale units helps prevent multi-master conflicts. Therefore, it's important that you understand which processes are owned by the hub and which are owned by the scale units.</p>
<p>The scale units own the following data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Wave processing data</strong> – Selected wave process methods are handled as part of the scale unit wave processing.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Work processing data</strong> – The following types of work order processing are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inventory movements (manual movement and movement by template work)</li>
<li>Purchase orders (putaway work via a warehouse order)</li>
<li>Sales orders (simple picking and loading work)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Warehouse order receipt data</strong> – This data is used only for purchase orders that are manually released to a warehouse.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>License plate data</strong> – License plates can be created on the hub and the scale unit. Dedicated conflict handling has been provided. Note that this data isn't warehouse-specific.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="outbound-process-flow">Outbound process flow</h2>
<p>The hub owns the following data:</p>
<ul>
<li>All source documents, such as sales orders and transfer orders</li>
<li>Order allocation and outbound load processing</li>
<li>The release to warehouse, shipment creation, and wave creation processes</li>
</ul>
<p>The scale units own the actual wave processing (such as work allocation, replenishment work, and demand work creation) after the release of the wave. Therefore, warehouse workers can process outbound work by using a warehouse app that is connected to the scale unit.</p>
<p><img src="media/wes_wave_processing_flow.png" alt="Wave processing flow" title="Wave processing flow"></p>
<h2 id="inbound-process-flow">Inbound process flow</h2>
<p>The hub owns the following data:</p>
<ul>
<li>All source documents, such as purchase orders and sales return orders</li>
<li>Inbound load processing</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The inbound purchase order flow is conceptually different from the outbound flow, where the scale unit that does the processing depends on whether the order has been released to a warehouse.</p>
</div>
<p>If you're using the <em>release to warehouse</em> process, warehouse orders are created, and ownership of the related receiving flow is assigned to the scale unit. The hub won't be able to register inbound receiving.</p>
<p>The worker can run the receiving process by using a warehouse app that is connected to the scale unit. The data is then recorded by the scale unit and reported against the inbound warehouse order. The creation and processing of the subsequent putaway will also be handled by the scale unit.</p>
<p>If you aren't using the <em>release to warehouse</em> process, and therefore aren't using <em>warehouse orders</em>, the hub can process warehouse receiving and work processing independently from scale units.</p>
<p><img src="media/WES_Inbound_flow.png" alt="Inbound process flow" title="Inbound process flow"></p>
<h2 id="supported-processes-and-roles">Supported processes and roles</h2>
<p>Not all warehouse management processes are supported in a WES workload on a scale unit. Therefore, we recommend that you assign roles that match the functionality that is available to each user.</p>
<p>To facilitate this process, a sample role that is named <em>Warehouse manager on workload</em> is included in the demo data at <strong>System administration &gt; Security &gt; Security configuration</strong>. The purpose of this role is to enable warehouse managers to access the WES on the scale unit. The role grants access to the pages that are relevant in the context of a workload that is hosted on a scale unit.</p>
<p>User roles on a scale unit are assigned as part of the initial data synchronization from the hub to the scale unit.</p>
<p>To modify the roles that are assigned to a user, go to <strong>System administration &gt; Security &gt; Assign users to roles</strong> on the scale unit. Users who act as warehouse managers only on scale units should be assigned only the <em>Warehouse manager on workload</em> role. This approach will ensure that those users have access only to the supported functionality. Remove any other roles that are assigned to those users.</p>
<p>Users who act as warehouse managers on both the hub and scale units should be assigned the existing <em>Warehouse worker</em> role. Be aware that this role grants warehouse workers access to features (such as transfer order processing) that appear in the user interface (UI) but aren't currently supported on scale units.</p>
<h2 id="supported-wes-processes">Supported WES processes</h2>
<p>The following warehouse execution processes can be enabled for a WES workload on a scale unit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selected wave methods for sales orders and demand replenishment</li>
<li>Running work orders from sales orders and demand replenishment by using the warehouse app</li>
<li>Querying on-hand inventory by using the warehouse app</li>
<li>Creating and running inventory movements by using the warehouse app</li>
<li>Registering purchase orders and doing putaway work by using the warehouse app</li>
</ul>
<p>The following work order types are currently supported for WES workloads on scale unit deployments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales orders</li>
<li>Replenishment</li>
<li>Inventory movement</li>
<li>Purchase orders that are linked to warehouse orders</li>
</ul>
<p>No other processing of source documents is currently supported on scale units. For example, for a WES workload on a scale unit, you can't perform the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Release a transfer order.</li>
<li>Process the outbound warehouse picking and shipping operations.</li>
</ul>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>If you use a workload on a scale unit, you can't run unsupported processes for the specific warehouse on the hub.</p>
</div>
<p>The following warehouse management functionality isn't currently supported on scale units:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inbound and outbound processing for items that have any active tracking dimensions (such as batch or serial number dimensions)</li>
<li>Processing of inventory status changes</li>
<li>Processing of inventory that has a blocking status value</li>
<li>Integration with quality management</li>
<li>Integration with production</li>
<li>Processing of catch-weight items</li>
<li>Processing of over-delivery and under-delivery</li>
<li>Processing of negative on-hand inventory</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="outbound-supported-only-for-sales-orders-and-demand-replenishment">Outbound (supported only for sales orders and demand replenishment)</h3>
<p>The following table shows which outbound features are supported, and where they are supported, when the warehouse management workloads are used in cloud and edge scale units.</p>
<div class="WARNING">
<h5>Warning</h5>
<p>Because only sales order processing is supported, outbound warehouse management processing can't be used for transfer orders.</p>
<p>Some warehouse functionality won't be available at warehouses that are running the warehouse management workloads in a scale unit.</p>
