<p>Accounting distributions are used to define how an amount will be accounted for, such as how the expense, tax, or charges will be accounted for on a vendor invoice. Every amount that must be accounted for when the vendor invoice is journalized will have one or more accounting distributions.</p>
<h2 id="accounting-distributions">Accounting distributions</h2>
<p>You can use the following buttons in the Vendor invoice page to view, and possibly modify, the accounting distributions for each amount on the vendor invoice.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distribute amounts</strong> – View and modify the accounting distributions for an individual line and any child lines, such as taxes or charges. You can also view and modify the accounting distributions for the child line directly from the Sales tax transactions page or the Charges transactions page.
<ul>
<li>Modify vendor invoice header amounts, such as charges or currency rounding amounts.</li>
<li>Modify vendor invoice line amounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>View distributions</strong> – View the accounting distributions for all lines on the document. You cannot modify the accounting distributions from this view.
<ul>
<li>View header and line amounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the vendor invoice references a purchase order, you can split and modify the accounting distributions for lines that contain an item that is not stocked. If the vendor invoice line does not reference a purchase order line, you can also delete an accounting distribution. You cannot split or delete lines for charges, taxes, and line discounts. You can modify the ledger account, but you cannot change the amounts or percentages.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>If the parent line contains an item that is not stocked and the accounting distributions are split, the child line will be split automatically to match the financial dimensions of the parent line. The accounting distributions for the child line cannot be additionally split or deleted, but depending on the setup of the child line, you might be able to modify the ledger account for the accounting distributions of the child line.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="distributing-taxes">Distributing taxes</h2>
<p>Accounting distributions for taxes cannot be created until taxes are calculated. To calculate sales taxes, you must complete one of the following tasks in the Vendor invoice page:</p>
<ul>
<li>View the invoice total.</li>
<li>View the sales tax.</li>
<li>View the subledger journal.</li>
<li>View accounting distributions for the complete vendor invoice.</li>
<li>Place the vendor invoice on hold.</li>
<li>Post the vendor invoice.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="subledger-journals-for-vendor-invoices">Subledger journals for vendor invoices</h2>
<p>Before you post a vendor invoice, you can view the full accounting entry of the invoice, which includes debits and credits, to verify that the invoice is being posted to the correct accounts. This view of the full accounting entry is called a subledger journal.</p>
<p>If the subledger journal entry is incorrect when you preview it before you journalize the vendor invoice, you cannot modify the subledger journal entry. Instead, you must modify the accounting distributions or the posting profile. The accounting distributions are used to define one side of the accounting entry, the debit or the credit. The offsetting subledger journal account entry is created by using the posting profiles, such as from the vendor account or tax.</p>
