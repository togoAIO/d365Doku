</ul>
<p>This information appears in the following areas in the column definition:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The headers area of the column definition contains the heading text and formatting that appears in the report. A header can apply to a single column of data, can span multiple columns, or can apply to columns on a conditional basis. The column definition can include as many column header rows as you require.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Column headers apply to each column of data on the report. Report headers apply to the whole report. You define report headers on the <strong>Headers and Footers</strong> tab of the report definition.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>If you have four or more rows of report headers on a report, the headers will overlap when the report is exported to an Excel worksheet. To view all headers on the report, increase the top margin in the report definition.</p>

</ol>
<h3 id="create-an-automatically-generated-header">Create an automatically generated header</h3>
<p>Report designer can automatically generate column headers, based on autotext codes. Autotext codes are variables that are updated every time that a report is generated. Any column header can include these codes to specify report information that can vary, such as dates or period numbers. Therefore, you can use one column definition for multiple report definitions, time periods, and reporting trees. Because autotext codes rely on the calendar information from the detail rows of the column definition, they are supported only for <strong>CALC</strong> and <strong>FD</strong> columns. The way that an autotext code appears in the column header cell affects how that information appears on the report. In the <strong>Column Header</strong> dialog box, the autotext codes appear in mixed case. Therefore, the text appears in mixed case on the report. For example, in a standard calendar year, <strong>@CalMonthLong</strong> resolves month <strong>7</strong> to <strong>July</strong>. If the name of the month should be uppercase (for example <strong>JULY</strong>), enter the autotext code in uppercase characters in the <strong>Column header text</strong> field. For example, enter <strong>@CALMONTHLONG</strong>. You can mix codes and text. For example, you enter the following header text: <strong>Period @FiscalPeriod-@FiscalYear from @StartDate to @EndDate</strong>. The report heading that is generated resembles the following text: <strong>Period 1-02 from 01/01/02 to 01/31/02</strong>.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The format of some of the text, such as the long date, depends on your regional settings on the server. To change these settings, click the <strong>Start</strong> button, click <strong>Control Panel</strong>, and then click <strong>Region and Language</strong>. The following table lists the available autotext options for column headers.</p>
</div>
<table>
<thead>

<h3 id="create-a-conditional-spanning-header">Create a conditional spanning header</h3>
<p>Conditional spanning headers can span multiple columns that are based on specific period data. For example, if you have a budget report for the fiscal year and want to display the actual budgets of past months together with the projected budgets of future months, you can use a conditional spanning header to automatically update the report header. Be aware of the following situations when you create a conditional spanning header:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any stop condition (<strong>Spread to</strong> field) that is matched before a start condition (<strong>Spread From</strong> field) is ignored. For example, column B has the spread condition defined as BASE+1 to BASE, BASE is in column C, and BASE+1 is in column D. In this case, the stop condition in column C is ignored, and the printing of the header starts at column D.</li>
<li>If you specify column headers that overlap, they overlap when they are printed on the report. The report is generated, but the following warning appears in the <strong>Report Queue Status</strong> field: &quot;Column headers using Base intersect with other column headers and may cause overlapping text.&quot; For example, the header definition on column B is B to BASE+1, and the header definition on column D is BASE+1 to F. In this case, the headers are printed on top of each other and are unreadable. Whenever BASE is used in a <strong>Spread from/Spread to</strong> definition, be sure to view the report that is generated, to see whether the headers overlap.</li>
<li>If you specify BASE in the spread definition in a No Print (<strong>NP</strong>) column, it's ignored, regardless of what is defined in the column definition. Essentially, this scenario is the same as not creating a column header definition.</li>
<li>For conditional printing columns (<strong>P&lt;B</strong>, <strong>P&gt;=B</strong>), conditional spanning headers behave like any regular column header definition. For example, if the condition is false, any subsequent column matching for the spread condition starts the printing of the header.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="create-a-conditional-spanning-header-1">Create a conditional spanning header</h4>
<ol>
<li>In Report Designer, open the column definition to modify.</li>
<li>Double-click a header cell.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Column Header</strong> dialog box, enter the column header text. Alternatively, click <strong>Insert AutoText</strong>, and select an option.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Format options</strong> field, select a formatting style for the header.</li>
<li>Specify a period relative to the base period that is specified when the report is generated. In the <strong>Spread from</strong> and <strong>Spread to</strong> fields, enter one of the following values: <strong>BASE</strong>, <strong>BASE-X</strong> or <strong>BASE+X</strong>, where X is the number of periods from the base period. For example, if you enter <strong>BASE</strong> in the <strong>Spread from</strong> field, the conditional spanning column header text starts in the column header where the report definition's <strong>Base period</strong> value equals the column definition's <strong>Period</strong> value. It ends in the column that is indicated in the <strong>Spread to</strong> field. Therefore, if the spread is BASE to M, and the report definition's <strong>Base period</strong> value is <strong>4</strong>, the header starts in the column where the period is set to <strong>4</strong> and ends at column M. Headers stop and start on printing columns only.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Justification</strong>, select whether the column header text should be left-justified, center-justified, or right justified.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="example-of-a-conditional-spanning-header">Example of a conditional spanning header</h4>
<p>A user is creating a report for a dynamic six-month forecast. The user wants the word &quot;Actual&quot; to be printed over the columns that contain actual data, and the word &quot;Budget&quot; to be printed over the columns that contain budget forecasts. Each month that the report is run, there is one more actual column and one less budget column. Although the user can modify the column definition manually each time that the report is generated to adjust the headers, to save time and effort, the user decides to create conditional spanning headers that will automatically create headers over the appropriate columns each time that the report is run. The user opens Report Designer, clicks <strong>Column Definition</strong> in the navigation pane, and opens the column definition for the report. The user then enters the following information. The base period in the report definition is 4.</p>

<h2 id="add-special-formatting-options">Add special formatting options</h2>
<p>In the column definition, the formatting column detail rows apply special formatting to selected columns. Although some of the <strong>Print Control</strong> options and <strong>Column Restrictions</strong> options are specific to <strong>FD</strong> columns, most of the options apply to all column types. The formatting that is specified in the column definition overrides the formatting that is specified in the report definition. However, the formatting that is specified in the row definition overrides the formatting that is specified in the column definition. The following rows are considered formatting rows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Column Width</li>
<li>Extra Spaces Before Column</li>
<li>Format/Currency Override</li>
<li>Print Control</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changing-the-column-width">Changing the column width</h3>
<p>The <strong>Column Width</strong> cell specifies the number of characters to use for the width of this column on the printed report. Column width is important for columns that contain amounts (columns of the <strong>CALC</strong>, <strong>WKS</strong>, or <strong>FD</strong> type), descriptions (columns of the <strong>DESC</strong> type), or fill (columns of the <strong>FILL</strong> type). By default, the <strong>AutoFit</strong> option is selected, so that the width of each column is automatically adjusted to fit the contents.</p>
<h4 id="specify-the-width-of-a-column-on-a-report">Specify the width of a column on a report</h4>
<ol>
<li>In Report Designer, open the column definition to modify.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Column Width</strong> cell, enter the number of spaces for the width of the column. The maximum width of any column is 255 characters (this number includes cents, commas, and parentheses). Alternatively, to enable report designer to select the appropriate width for the column, based on the cell content, double-click the <strong>Column Width</strong> cell, and then click <strong>AutoFit</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="add-space-between-columns">Add space between columns</h3>
<p>The <strong>Extra Spaces Before Column</strong> cell specifies the width of the separator between one column and adjacent columns in the column definition. The <strong>Extra Spaces Before Column</strong> setting affects all column detail rows for the column, but not the column header rows. Use this option to separate groups of columns or to add a few spaces before the description, so that the description column is indented from the left-aligned titles on the report. The default number of spaces between each column is two. You can change this setting on the <strong>Settings</strong> tab in the report definition.</p>
<h4 id="specify-the-space-between-columns">Specify the space between columns</h4>

<h3 id="specify-a-format-currency-override">Specify a format currency override</h3>
<p>The <strong>Format/Currency Override</strong> cell specifies the formatting of the decimal, currency, and percentage amounts in the column. This formatting overrides any formatting that is specified in the report definition or system defaults.</p>

<h3 id="dimension-filter-in-a-column-definition">Dimension filter in a column definition</h3>
<p>A dimension filter is used to restrict the <strong>FD</strong> column to specific dimension values. The filter can include a single dimension, a range of dimensions, or a group of dimensions. The filter can also include dimension value sets. Because dimension values can vary, a ..\financial-dimensions\dimension-based system doesn't have to correspond to an exact length. The filter is applied, regardless of whether the report includes a reporting tree. You can use a wildcard character (* or ?) in any position. When you specify multiple accounts, put a comma between accounts, as in the following example: +Account=[1200], +Account=[1100], Department=[01?] To receive all departments for a specific account, you can exclude the Department dimension from the dimension filter. For example, both of the following dimension filters are handled in the same way:</p>
<ul>
<li>+Account=[1100],Department</li>
<li>+Account=[1100]</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use any combination of alphanumeric characters for exact matching, and you can define partial dimensions. For example, <strong>Location = [10*]</strong> includes all location dimension values that begin with 10.</p>

<h3 id="format-a-multiple-currency-report-in-a-column-definition">Format a multiple-currency report in a column definition</h3>
<p>A multiple-currency report can display amounts in the ledger's accounting currency, the ledger's reporting, the originating transaction currency, or the translated reporting currency. A company's accounting currency is defined in the Ledgers setup. Don't confuse this setting with the operating system's regional options setting, where you can configure the default currency symbols that are used on reports. The following currency-related cells are available in the column definition:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Currency Display</strong> – Specify the type of currency (accounting, reporting, transaction, or translated reporting) that the transactions are displayed in. Translated to a reporting currency functionality is sometimes referred to as currency translation. Currency translation is the ability to report general ledger amounts in a currency that might not be the functional or reporting currency of the company or the currency that the transaction was entered in.</li>
<li><strong>Currency Filter</strong> – Specify a currency filter. Only transactions that are entered in the selected currency are displayed on the report.</li>

<h4 id="divide-the-amount-in-a-column-by-the-number-of-periods">Divide the amount in a column by the number of periods</h4>
<p>You can divide the amount in a column by a specified number of periods. For example, the formula <strong>B/Periods</strong> divides the value in column B by the number of periods in column B. If the calculation spans multiple columns, specify the number of periods to use in the calculation. For example, the formula <strong>(B+C)/Periods</strong> adds the amounts in column B and column C, and then divides the result by the period value.</p>
