Then, when you create a work order job for the asset, the work order project for the work order job automatically gets the financial dimensions that are now related to the asset. Therefore, when you use functional locations, costs can always be tracked on the functional locations that an asset was installed on at any given time. The automatic update of financial dimensions helps guarantee complete traceability of costs for project control and reporting.</p>
