<p sourcefile="finance/accounts-receivable/waive-reinstate-reverse-interest-fees.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">This article explains how to waive, reinstate, and reverse charges for interest and fees.</p>
<p sourcefile="finance/accounts-receivable/waive-reinstate-reverse-interest-fees.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">You can use the buttons on the <strong sourcefile="finance/accounts-receivable/waive-reinstate-reverse-interest-fees.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">Collect</strong> tab of the <strong sourcefile="finance/accounts-receivable/waive-reinstate-reverse-interest-fees.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">All customers</strong> list page to waive, reverse, or reinstate charges:</p>
<ul sourcefile="finance/accounts-receivable/waive-reinstate-reverse-interest-fees.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">
<li sourcefile="finance/accounts-receivable/waive-reinstate-reverse-interest-fees.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">Waived charges are forgiven. You might waive a charge if, for example, a customer disputes the charge, and you want to maintain a good business relationship with that customer.</li>
<li sourcefile="finance/accounts-receivable/waive-reinstate-reverse-interest-fees.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">Reinstated charges become due again. You can reinstate charges that were previously waived. You might have to reinstate charges if you determine that they should not have been waived.</li>
<li sourcefile="finance/accounts-receivable/waive-reinstate-reverse-interest-fees.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">Reversed charges are removed from a customer’s account and are no longer due. You might reverse charges if, for example, the wrong interest rate was selected to calculate the amount that a customer owes. You can use a separate process to recalculate interest and create an interest note that contains new charges for the customer.</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="finance/accounts-receivable/waive-reinstate-reverse-interest-fees.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">All these actions change an interest note. An interest note is a business document that informs customers when interest or fees have been charged to their account. When you waive or reverse interest or fees, a credit note or adjustment invoice is automatically created to settle the charges. If you reinstate waived charges, an invoice that has a debit amount is automatically created to reinstate the charges that the customer owes. The following table describes the results of each action.</p>

<td sourcefile="finance/accounts-receivable/waive-reinstate-reverse-interest-fees.md" sourcestartlinenumber="48">A credit note, or adjustment invoice, is created for the customer. The credit not is used to automatically settle the interest note, or the interest transactions or fees that you selected. The settled amount equals the total amount of the charges, minus any previous payments that the customer made, and minus any amounts that were previously waived or written off. If the amount of the credit note exceeds the amount that the customer owes, you can convert the credit note to a vendor invoice. You can then give the customer a refund.</td>

The actual interest notes aren't reinstated. Instead, an invoice is created that shows the amount that is due from the customer. The credit notes, or adjustment invoices, that were created to settle waived interest notes can still exist if they weren't used to settle the interest notes. In this case, the outstanding credit notes are canceled. Outstanding credit notes are usually automatically settled when interest notes are waived. However, an outstanding credit note might exist if a customer paid an interest note, even though the customer disputed the charges.</td>
