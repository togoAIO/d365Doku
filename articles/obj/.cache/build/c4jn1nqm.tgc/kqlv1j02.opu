This data source is configured as <strong>$RRG.$Section3.$data = LISTJOIN(@.'$dataStd', @.'$dataCustom')</strong>. It refers to two data sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$RRG.$Section3.$data.$dataStd</strong> – This data source is configured to access the <strong>VAT Declaration helper (RU)</strong> application class by calling the <strong>getSection3data</strong> method. This method produces a list that has the amounts of several boxes in section 3.</li>
<li><strong>$RRG.$Section3.$data.$dataCustom</strong> – This data source is configured to access the <strong>LedgerRRGCustomReportHelper_RU</strong> application class by calling the <strong>getCustomReportData</strong> method. This method produces the record list that has calculated amounts for some financial report cells that the user configured.</li>
</ul>
<p>To customize the declaration, follow one of these steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Set up the financial report to calculate cells that aren't automatically calculated by the <strong>VAT Declaration helper (RU)</strong> class.</p>
<p>In this case, you should to set up financial report calculation rules for report cells that aren't marked with an asterisk (*) in the tables in the previous section.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Set up the financial report to fully calculate cells based on the user setup instead of through automatic calculation.</p>
<p>In this case, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up financial report calculation rules for all required cells. These required cells include the cells that marked with an asterisk (*) in the tables in the previous section.</li>
<li>Create a customized <strong>Model mapping</strong> ER configuration. Derive it from the configuration that is provided by the Microsoft configuration provider.</li>
<li>In the customized <strong>Model mapping</strong> ER configuration that you created in the previous step, redefine the model mapping data source so that it's configured as <strong>$RRG.$Section3.$data = '$dataCustom'</strong> instead of <strong>$RRG.$Section3.$data = LISTJOIN(@.'$dataStd', @.'$dataCustom')</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Extend the <strong>VAT Declaration helper (RU)</strong> class. (Use methods that start with <strong>getSection3data</strong>, such as <strong>getSection3dataDomesticVAT</strong>.) Or, in a similar manner, create alternative helper methods that calculate the required cells values.</p>
<p>In this case, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a customized <strong>Model mapping</strong> ER configuration. Derive it from the configuration that is provided by the Microsoft configuration provider.</li>
<li>Redefine the <strong>$RRG.$Section3.$data.$dataStd</strong> data source element of the model mapping.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="application-1-to-section-3">Application 1 to section 3</h2>
<p>Application 1 contains information about fixed assets that are used in non-taxable activities. It's generated in the last reporting period of the calendar year and contains the restored VAT amount for the fixed asset that was calculated for the whole calendar year. Data for application 1 is generated based on VAT restoration journal entries.</p>
<p>Application 1 contains the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the fixed asset (line 010)</li>
<li>The date when the fixed asset was put into operation (line 030)</li>
<li>The depreciation start date (line 040)</li>
<li>The initial cost of the fixed asset (line 050)</li>
<li>The incoming VAT amount that is related to the fixed asset and that was deducted (line 060)</li>
<li>The year when VAT restoration begins, until the tenth year of depreciation for the fixed asset (line 070, column 1)</li>
<li>The date when the fixed asset was first used in non-taxable operations (line 070, column 2)</li>
<li>The percentage of revenue for non-taxable goods and export operations (line 070, column 3)</li>
<li>The VAT amount that was restored for the fixed asset in a year (line 070, column 4)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sections-for-exports-that-are-taxed-at-a-rate-of-0-percent">Sections for exports that are taxed at a rate of 0 percent</h2>
<p>Before you generate the sections of the VAT declaration for exports that are taxed at a rate of 0 percent, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Tax &gt; Setup &gt; Sales tax &gt; VAT operation codes</strong>, and create VAT operation codes for export trade.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Tax &gt; Indirect taxes &gt; Sales tax &gt; Sales tax codes</strong>, and assign VAT operation codes to sales tax codes.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="overview-and-example">Overview and example</h3>
<p>Sections for export are generated based on the registration of export factures and on VAT restoration journal entries.<!-- For more information about how to process export transactions, see [Processing invoice factures for export trade]().--></p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>January 2018:</strong> Products are purchased, and two documents are received: Invoice V1 and Facture1.</p>
<ul>
<li>Invoice V1/Facture1: 10 pieces for a total amount of 118,000 Russian rubles (RUB). This amount includes 18-percent VAT (18,000 RUB).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>January 2018:</strong> Incoming VAT is deducted for Facture1.</p>
<ul>
<li>82,600 RUB, which includes 18-percent VAT (12,600 RUB)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the incoming facture includes only some of the goods that were purchased by using Invoice V1.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>April 2018:</strong> Products are sold for export, at an exchange rate of 45 RUB to 1 US dollar (USD).</p>
<ul>
<li>Invoice C1: 2 pieces at 600 USD = 27,000 RUB (The corresponding incoming VAT amount is 3,600 RUB.)</li>
<li>Invoice C2: 8 pieces at 2,400 USD = 108,000 RUB (The corresponding incoming VAT amount is 14,400 RUB.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, September 2018 is the deadline for collecting all the documents for confirmation of export at a rate of 0 percent.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>August 2018:</strong> The export for Invoice C1 is confirmed before the deadline.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>September 2018:</strong> The export for Invoice C2 isn't confirmed before the deadline. Therefore, VAT for this invoice is calculated at the domestic VAT rate of 18 percent (108,000 × 18 percent = 19,440 RUB).</p>
<p>The amount of the corresponding incoming VAT deduction for the unconfirmed export is 9,000 RUB.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>November 2018:</strong> Facture2 is received for the remaining goods that were purchased by using Invoice V1. Therefore, the incoming VAT deduction for the remaining part of Invoice V1 is posted.</p>
<ul>
<li>35,400 RUB, which includes 18-percent VAT (5,400 RUB) (This amount is for the goods that were purchased by using Invoice C2.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For this example, the VAT declaration for the third quarter of 2018 will contain sections 4 and 6. The VAT declaration for the fourth quarter of 2018 will contain section 5.</p>
<p>The following sections provide more details about this example.</p>

<li>Adjustment: The restored VAT amount that was deducted in previous periods for an unconfirmed export (line 050)</li>
</ul>
