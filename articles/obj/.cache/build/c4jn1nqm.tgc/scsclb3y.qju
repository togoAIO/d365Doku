<p sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="33">Engineering change management provides structured processes for managing changes to engineering products. You can use the <em sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="33">engineering change request</em> process to propose and request changes, and then use the <em sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="33">engineering change order</em> process to actually make those changes. Users can create engineering change requests or engineering change orders, and there is then a process for reviewing and approving them, assessing their impact on existing transactions, and following up on them.</p>
<h2 id="engineering-change-requests" sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="35">Engineering change requests</h2>
<p sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="37">The engineering change request process lets you capture requests for changes from all the relevant departments in your company. It doesn't matter whether you work as an engineer, or in the Manufacturing, Sourcing, Warehouse, or Sales department: anybody can use an engineering change request to request a change. This change might be an idea for a new product, an issue that you discovered while you were working with an existing product, a suggestion for improving an existing product, or something else.</p>
<p sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">After someone submits a request for change, the <em sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">review and approval</em> process is managed by a workflow that identifies who must approve the change (for example, the product owner).</p>
<p sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">To set up a workflow for engineering change orders or engineering change requests, go to <strong sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">Engineering change management &gt; Engineering workflows</strong>. Select <strong sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">New</strong>, select whether the workflow will be used to review engineering change orders or engineering change requests, and then configure the workflow.</p>

You propose changes by using a copy of the engineering-relevant data. The real master data isn't affected. For more information about engineering-relevant data, see <a href="engineering-versions-product-category.html" sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="120">Engineering versions and engineering product categories</a>.</p>
<p sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="122">You can create an engineering change order that is based on an approved engineering change request. Engineers can also create engineering change orders from scratch. You can include multiple products on a single engineering change order by following any of these steps:</p>
<ul sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="124">
<li sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="124">Manually select products.</li>
<li sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="125">Use the bill of materials (BOM) to include products that are lower in the product structure (that is, children).</li>
<li sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="126">Use a where-used search to include products that are higher in the product structure (that is, parents).</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="128">After the proposal for changes is completed, the review and approval process will be handled by a workflow. You can set up different workflows, based on priority and severity.</p>
<p sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="130">To set up a workflow for engineering change orders or engineering change requests, go to <strong sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="130">Engineering change management &gt; Engineering workflows</strong>. Select <strong sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="130">New</strong>, select whether the workflow will be used to review engineering change orders or engineering change requests, and then configure the workflow.</p>
<p sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="132">For more information about workflows, see <a href="../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/overview-workflow-system.html" sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="132">Workflow system overview</a>.</p>
<p sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="134">Here are some typical stakeholders who might have to approve an engineering change order:</p>
<ul sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="136">

</ul>
<p sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="140">You can choose whether the engineering change order should be processed directly after it's approved, as part of the workflow, or whether the processing should be done later, as a manual step. During processing of an engineering change order, engineering data on the actual product is updated.</p>
<p sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="142">While you're reviewing a request for change, on the Action Pane, on the <strong sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="142">Change request</strong> tab, in the <strong sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="142">Business impact</strong> group, select <strong sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="142">Search</strong> to assess the impact of the proposed change on open transactions, such as sales orders, production orders, and inventory on-hand.

<p sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="146">As is described in <a href="engineering-org-data-ownership-rules.html" sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="146">Engineering companies and data ownership rules</a>, the product data that you can edit varies, depending on the type of legal entity that you're working in (an engineering company versus an operational company). Data ownership rules are also applied to engineering change orders. Therefore, depending on the legal entity where you create an engineering change order, different types of changes can be made. Here are some examples:</p>

For example, you can enrich the existing BOM with settings for sourcing, add local routes or local BOMs, and even enrich a BOM by adding new BOM lines for local packaging materials, lubrication fluids, or instructions in the local language. Enrichments that users make in the operational company will be preserved when new updates are sent from the engineering company.

<p sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="156">When engineering change orders are processed in the engineering company, the products are created and/or updated only in the engineering company. Therefore, if the product master data should also be updated, you must also release the products to operational companies.</p>

<p sourcefile="supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-change-management.md" sourcestartlinenumber="166">As soon as an engineering change request is approved, you can follow up on it via an engineering change order. You can combine multiple engineering change requests into a single engineering change order. A single engineering change order can even include multiple products. (Typically, you use this approach when the same change must be applied to multiple products.) However, you can't create multiple engineering change orders from a single engineering change request.</p>
