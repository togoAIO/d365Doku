<p>This topic explains how to set hazardous material properties for released products, how to put stock limits on hazardous items, and how to include hazardous materials in a sales order, shipment, or load.</p>
<h2 id="set-hazardous-material-specifications-for-products">Set hazardous material specifications for products</h2>
<p>After you've defined a hazardous material regulation and set up the related reference codes as described in <a href="hazmat-setup.html">Set up hazardous materials</a>, you can associate this information with released items. The shipping text for shipping documents will be drawn from the hazardous materials information for the released items.</p>
<p>As part of the process of associating a released item with a hazardous material, you must specify the regulation code and the material. Different regulation codes might be associated with an item, depending on the modes of transport, and you can associate multiple regulations and material codes with each item.</p>
<p>To set up a released product as a hazardous material, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Product information management &gt; Products &gt; Released products</strong>.</li>
<li>Select or create a product to open its <strong>Released product details</strong> page.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Manage inventory</strong> FastTab, set the <strong>Hazardous material</strong> option to <strong>Yes</strong>. This setting identifies the item as a dangerous good and is used when shipping documentation is printed.</li>
<li>On the Action Pane, on the <strong>Manage inventory</strong> tab, in the <strong>Compliance</strong> group, select <strong>Item hazardous material</strong>.</li>
<li>Fill in the <strong>Item hazardous materials</strong> page for the selected item by using the fields that are described in the following subsections.</li>

<h4 id="how-the-hazardous-material-score-is-calculated">How the hazardous material score is calculated</h4>
<p>Several of the values that are specified on the <strong>Material management</strong> FastTab for a product are used to calculate a <em>hazardous material score</em> for each load line that includes that product. The score is calculated by using the following formula:</p>
<p>Hazardous material score = <em>&lt;LineQty&gt;</em> × <em>&lt;HazmatQty&gt;</em> × <em>&lt;UnitConversion&gt;</em> × <em>&lt;Multiplier&gt;</em></p>
<p>Here is a key to the formula:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&lt;LineQty&gt;</em> is the quantity of product that is specified for a load line.</li>
<li><em>&lt;HazmatQty&gt;</em> is the quantity of hazardous material that is specified for a product in the <strong>Quantity</strong> field on the <strong>Material management</strong> FastTab.</li>
<li><em>&lt;UnitConversion&gt;</em> is a conversion factor for converting between the unit that is used for the load line quantity and the unit that is specified for a product in the <strong>Unit</strong> field on the <strong>Material management</strong> FastTab.</li>
<li><em>&lt;Multiplier&gt;</em> is the multiplier that is specified for a product in the <strong>Multiplier</strong> field on the <strong>Material management</strong> FastTab.</li>
</ul>
<p>This score is reported for each load line that contains a product where these values are specified. For more information, see the <a href="#hazmat-shipments">Shipments that include hazardous materials</a> and <a href="#hazmat-loads">Loads that include hazardous materials</a> sections later in this topic.</p>
<h4 id="how-the-hazardous-material-weight-is-calculated">How the hazardous material weight is calculated</h4>
<p>Loads and load lines that contain products where the <strong>Limited quantity</strong> option on the <strong>Material management</strong> FastTab is set to <strong>Yes</strong> will show the total hazardous material weight, as described in the <a href="#hazmat-shipments">Shipments that include hazardous materials</a> and <a href="#hazmat-loads">Loads that include hazardous materials</a> sections later in this topic. The hazardous material weight is calculated by using the following formula:</p>
<p>Hazardous material weight = <em>&lt;LineQty&gt;</em> × <em>&lt;ProductWeight&gt;</em> × <em>&lt;UnitConversion&gt;</em></p>
<p>Here is a key to the formula:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&lt;LineQty&gt;</em> is the quantity of product that is specified for a load line.</li>
<li><em>&lt;ProductWeight&gt;</em> is the net weight that is specified for the product, in the inventory unit that is specified for the product.</li>
<li><em>&lt;UnitConversion&gt;</em> is a conversion factor for converting between the unit that is used for the load line quantity and the inventory unit that is used for <em>&lt;ProductWeight&gt;</em>.</li>

<h2 id="stock-limits">Set stock limits for hazardous products</h2>
<p>For safety reasons, you might have to limit the total amount of a given product that can be stocked at a single location. To set stock limits for a released product, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Product information management &gt; Products &gt; Released products</strong>.</li>
<li>Select a product to open its <strong>Released product details</strong> page.</li>
<li>On the Action Pane, on the <strong>Manage inventory</strong> tab, in the <strong>Compliance</strong> group, select <strong>Reporting details</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Hazardous stock limit</strong> and <strong>Hazardous warning limit</strong> fields, set appropriate values for the selected product.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>Hazardous material stock limit</strong> report lets you monitor the stock levels of the hazardous materials in your warehouse locations, to make sure that they remain under the safe limits that are established here. For more information, see <a href="hazmat-reports.html#stock-limit-report">Hazardous material stock limit report</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sales-order-transactions-that-include-hazardous-materials">Sales order transactions that include hazardous materials</h2>
<p>To include a product that is classified as a hazardous material on a sales order, you must associate the relevant shipping carrier with the sales order. Open the sales order, and then, on the <strong>Delivery</strong> FastTab, set the <strong>Shipping carrier</strong> and <strong>Carrier service</strong> fields as required.</p>
<p>The shipping carrier is also associated with the mode of delivery. Therefore, you must make sure that this information is aligned with the hazardous material regulation. In other words, the mode of delivery that is specified in the hazardous material regulation must match the specifications on the sales order header. In this way, the regulation, shipping carrier, and service are connected to the shipment lines that are used on a sales order.</p>
<p>After a sales order is finalized and ready to be shipped, it can be released to the warehouse to indicate the transfer between sales and warehouse operations.</p>
<h2 id="hazmat-shipments">Shipments that include hazardous materials</h2>
<h3 id="view-hazardous-material-scores-for-each-shipment-line">View hazardous material scores for each shipment line</h3>
<p>The <strong>Shipment details</strong> page for a shipment shows the total hazardous material weight and point values that have been calculated for each load line that is included in that shipment. To view the scores and weights, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Warehouse management &gt; Shipments &gt; All shipments</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select a shipment to open its <strong>Shipment details</strong> page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Load lines</strong> FastTab, inspect the lines. For each line, you will see the hazardous material calculations in the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hazardous material points</strong> – This field shows the hazardous material score for the load line. The value is calculated according to the rules and values that have been established for the applicable regulation and in the released product setup.

<li><strong>Limited quantity net weight</strong> – For products that are marked as limited-quantity products because of their hazardous material content, this field shows the total net weight of hazardous content that is included on the load line. The calculation is based on the products that are marked as hazardous materials in the released product setup. If an item is marked as a limited-quantity item, the calculation takes the quantity on each load line and references the weight in the <a href="#material-management">material management setup</a> for the released product.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="check-for-compatibility-among-hazardous-materials-that-are-included-in-a-shipment">Check for compatibility among hazardous materials that are included in a shipment</h3>
<p>The system can evaluate whether all the hazardous materials that are included in a shipment are suitable to be shipped together. To evaluate compatibility, the system checks the compatibility group that is assigned to each product that is included in the shipment. For more information, see <a href="hazmat-setup.html#compatibility-groups">Hazardous material compatibility groups</a>.</p>
