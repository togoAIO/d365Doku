<h2 id="critical-fixes" sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="61">Critical fixes</h2>
<ul sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="63">
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="63">A stock transfer has the same tax rate applicability at the time of shipment and receipt, including partial receipt. This means that tax was calculated on the new HSN code percentage instead of on the transfer order before the change in the HSN code percentage, which caused revenue loss to the customer.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">Tax information fields weren't updated automatically when copied from the original free text invoice. The system updates the tax information related fields in the free text invoice lines that were copied from the original invoice line after tax. The tax document now displays the correct tax amount.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="65">When the invoice journal was posted with TDS, users could reverse one transaction line from the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="65">Vendor transaction</strong> page and adjust the withholding tax through the General journal. Then, when the withholding tax payment was run, an error would occur. This occurred because the vendor invoice journal with TDS wasn't getting the ledger account through the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="65">TaxWHTransGeneralJournalAccountEntry</strong> table.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">In a multi-line invoice journal, when the transaction date is modified, only the first line in the tax document is updated with the corrected date when all of the lines must be updated with the latest transaction date.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="67">When posting the general journal entry by using <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="67">Account type as project</strong> and <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="67">Offset account type as a vendor</strong> with the load on inventory and a reverse charge of 100 percent, the system doesn't allow the entry and the following error displays, “The transactions on voucher INMF-00545 do not balance as per 3/25/2020 (Accounting currency: -2500, Reporting currency: -2500).” After this fix, posting the project entry with the load on inventory and reverse charge percentage from the general journal system will allow posting without any imbalance error.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">Removed and inactive addresses are appearing under the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">Location</strong> field on the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">Tax information</strong> page for invoices that are generated through the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">Invoice journal</strong> and the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">Free text invoice</strong>. The removed and inactive addresses will no longer appear in the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">Location</strong> field.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="69">Lookup condition is linked to two different component measure owners.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Voucher details are not showing in the posted journal during the process of settling the post-dated check. With this fix, the line shows on the grid.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="71">An error occurs when posting an invoice journal that has multiple lines with TDS where the exchange rate changed after creating lines in the invoice journal.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="72">With this fix, the system posts the invoice journal (multiline) transaction successfully including TDS where the exchange rate is changed after all the lines are created in the invoice journal. The system will select the latest defined exchange rate for the whole transaction.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="73">The WHT tax group isn't editable during invoice processing in India Legal Entity when a transaction is posted through the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="73">Pending invoice</strong> page. With this fix, the TDS/TCS group will be editable on the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="73">Purchase order pending invoice</strong> page for the line. You will be able to update the TDS/ TCS-related fields on the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="73">Pending invoice</strong> page during invoicing.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">The source details in the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">GST</strong> number sequence group were deleted. With this fix, you can't delete the source details in the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">GST reference</strong> number sequence group if they are attached to a transaction. If you don't attach the source details to the transaction, you can delete the source details and then add them again.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="75">Charges are not automatically updated in the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="75">Assessable value</strong> field on the sales order line when charges are applied through the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="75">Auto charges</strong> functionality even when the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="75">Assessable value</strong> check box is selected during setup. Charges are not auto-updating on the sales order line to include the charge amount in the assessable value of goods. After this fix, charges will be auto-updated on the sales order line when the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="75">Assessable value</strong> check box in selected and it will be part of the assessable value for tax calculation.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">It is now possible to import general journal lines with tax using the data import-export feature. However, when the tax document was verified, all of the tax information from the imported general journal transaction was missing. To fix this issue, updates were made to the data entity, <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">Ledger journal line transaction tax information</strong>.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="77">When a balancing financial dimension is updated in the ledger and the financial dimension isn't set in the authority vendor, the following error occurred, <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="77">The transactions on voucher xxx do not balance as per xxx</strong>.

With this fix, when the balancing the financial dimension is updated on the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="77">Ledger</strong> page, an error message will appear to check whether the financial dimension is set in the authorized vendor.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="78">When you create a new customer, the system writes a record, <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="78">TaxInformationCustTable_IN</strong> with <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="78">TaxInformationCustTable_IN.CustTable=''</strong>, and then updates it with the customer account number.

<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-news-letter-10-0-12.md" sourcestartlinenumber="86">In an intercompany transaction, when a sales order is posted in one company, a purchase order is automatically generated in another company.
