<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="37">Loyalty programs can help increase customer loyalty by rewarding customers for their interactions with the retailer's brand. In Dynamics 365 Commerce, you can set up simple or complex loyalty programs that apply across your legal entities in any commerce channel. This topic describes the loyalty capabilities within Commerce and the corresponding setup steps to help the retailer easily get started with their loyalty programs.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">You can set up your loyalty program so that they include the following options.</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">
<li sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">Set up multiple types of rewards that you offer in your loyalty programs, and track participation in your loyalty programs.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">Set up loyalty programs that represent the different reward incentives that you offer. You can include loyalty program tiers to offer greater incentives and rewards to customers who shop more frequently or spend more money in your stores.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="43">Define earning rules to identify the activities that a customer must complete to earn rewards. You can also define redemption rules to identify when and how a customer can redeem rewards.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">Issue loyalty cards from any channel that participates in your loyalty programs, and link loyalty cards to one or more loyalty programs that the customer can participate in. You can also link a customer record to a loyalty card, so that the customer can pool loyalty points from multiple cards and redeem them.</li>

Unvested points can be viewed in the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="105">Unvested points</strong> column on the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="105">Loyalty cards</strong> page. When the customers return some items for which the loyalty points were earned, then by default, the system will deduct the unvested points first and then deduct any balance from the available points. However, you can configure to deduct the available points only instead of deducting from unvested points.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="107">Additionally, retailers can define the maximum loyalty reward point limit per loyalty card. This field can be used to reduce the impact of loyalty fraud. When the maximum award points have been reached, the user cannot earn more points. The retailer can decide to block such cards until they have investigated for potential fraud. If the retailer determines fraud, the retailer can block the loyalty card for the customer and mark the customer as blocked. To do this, set the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="107">Block customer for loyalty enrollment</strong> property to <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="107">Yes</strong> under <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="107">All customers</strong> on the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="107">Commerce</strong> FastTab. The blocked customers will not be able to be issued a loyalty card in any of the channels.</p>

For example, an affiliation titled &quot;High spend customer&quot; might not be well received by some customers. Moreover, there are some affiliations that should not be managed in the store, for example, employees, because you do not want the cashiers to decide who is an employee and thus provide employee-based discounts. Retailers can now select the affiliations which should be hidden in the  channels. Affiliations marked as <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="111">Hide in channels</strong> cannot be viewed, added, or removed in the POS.

The enrollment source for the loyalty cards is now saved so that retailers can run reports on this data.

For the loyalty cards issued from the back office application, the call center user can select an appropriate channel.</p>

However, in those releases, because the loyalty balance is displayed in loyalty points, the cashier could not view the currency value amount that could be applied toward the current transaction. The cashier had to do the points to currency conversion before paying by loyalty points. In the current release, after lines are added to the transaction the cashier can see the amount that the loyalty points can cover for the current transaction, making it easy to apply some or all of the loyalty points to the transaction. Additionally, the cashier can see the points that will be expiring in next 30 days, so they can upsell or cross-sell to motivate the customer to spend the expiring points at that transaction.</p>

<li sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="139"><p sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="139">Many retailers award loyalty points only based on the sales transactions, but the more customer-centric retailers want to reward their customers for any of their engagement activity with their brand. For example, they want to provide rewards for completing an online survey, visiting a store, liking the retailers on Facebook, or tweeting about the retailer. To do this, the retailer can define any number of &quot;Other activity type&quot; and define the corresponding earning rules for these activities. There is also an exposed Commerce Scale Unit API &quot;PostNonTransactionalActivityLoyaltyPoints&quot; that can be called when an activity is identified that should reward the customer with loyalty points. This API expects the Loyalty card ID, Channel ID, and the Other Activity Type ID, so that the customer who should be rewarded can be located and the earning rule for the activity can be identified.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="141">Awarding points for non-transaction activities generally has two major steps:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="143">
<li sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="143">Realizing an activity has occurred that should be rewarded.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="144">Rewarding the appropriate points.</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="146">The first step is external to Commerce, such as tweeting about the brand or liking the brand on Facebook. After this activity has been recognized, the retailers can call the above-mentioned Commerce Scale Unit API and award loyalty points in real time. In such scenarios, there is no need for a review step because an activity has occurred and corresponding points should be awarded. However, there are scenarios where the retailer would want to review the records prior to awarding the points. For example, the retailer has set up a workshop in the store for which the customers sign up on the ecommerce website or any other event registering application. However, only the attending customers should earn loyalty points. For such scenarios, in the 10.0 release, we introduced a data entity named <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="146">Retail loyalty other activity type lines</strong>. This data entity enables the retailers to use either Data Import/Export Framework (DIXF) or OData API to record the activities that should award customers with loyalty points. The data entity stores the activities in a journal named <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="146">Loyalty lines for other activities</strong>, which can be used for review and modification purposes. After the data has been reviewed, the IT user can either manually post the activity lines or run a job named <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="146">Process other activity type for loyalty lines</strong>, which will post all the unposted activity lines and award the points to the customers based on the earning rules. In the above scenario, the event registration application would call OData API to send the customer information to Commerce. However, the IT user can post the activity lines for only those customers who attended the workshop and delete the activity lines for the other customers.</p>

<h5>Note</h5>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="149">Currently, the system forces users to set up a number sequence for &quot;other activity types&quot;, but this will not be a required step in future releases. To set up a number sequence, go to <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="149">Commerce shared parameters</strong> &gt; <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="149">Number sequences</strong> and select a number sequence for <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="149">Loyalty other activity type ID</strong>.</p>

With the 10.0 release, cashiers will be able to see loyalty history details along with the associated loyalty program and tier information on POS.</p>
</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="152"><p sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="152">Free or discounted shipping is one of the highly motivating factors for customers to buy online. To enable the retailers to set up shipping promotions, with the 10.0 release, we have introduced a new type of promotion named &quot;Shipping threshold discount,&quot; where the retailer can define the thresholds, which once met, will qualify the customers for discounted or free shipping. For example, spend $35 for free 'Two day ship' or Free 'Two day ship' for all loyalty customers. This feature leverages the new Advanced auto charges capability. Refer the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/retail/omni-auto-charges" sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="152">documentation on Advanced auto charges</a>. These advanced auto charges need to be enabled for shipping promotion to work. These can be enabled from the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="152">Customer orders</strong> tab on the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="152">Commerce parameters</strong> page and turn on the &quot;Use advanced auto-charges&quot; configuration. Additionally, because a retailer can set up multiple types of charges, such as handling or installation, the retailer needs to specify which charge is considered shipping charge. The shipping discounts are only applied to the shipping charges. To specify charge as Shipping charge, navigate to the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="152">Charge codes</strong> form present under <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="152">Retail and Commerce</strong> &gt; <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="152">Retail and Commerce IT</strong> &gt; <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="152">Channel setup</strong> &gt; <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="152">Charges</strong> and turn on the &quot;Shipping charge&quot; checkbox for the desired charges. Now you can navigate to the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="152">Shipping threshold discount</strong> form and set up the discount.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="154">Like product discounts, this discount honors all the existing standard discount capabilities, such as allowing the retailer to restrict these discounts with the coupons so that only the customers with coupons can get these discounts. Also, these discounts leverage the Price groups capability to determine the eligibility of such discounts. For example, the retailer can choose to run these promotions only in the online channels and/or across channels for certain customer groups such as loyalty customers. After the order lines with the specified delivery mode meets the defined threshold, then the shipping discount gets applied and reduces the shipping charge based on the discount set up.</p>
<div class="NOTE" sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="156">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md" sourcestartlinenumber="157">Unlike other periodic discounts such as quantity, simple, mix and match, and threshold discounts, the shipping discount does not create discount lines, rather edits the shipping charge directly and appends the name of the discount to the charge description.</p>
