<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/deferred-put.md" sourcestartlinenumber="35">This topic describes the functionality that makes deferred processing of put operations for warehouse work available in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/deferred-put.md" sourcestartlinenumber="37">The deferred processing functionality lets warehouse workers continue to do other work while the put operation is processed in the background. Deferred processing is useful when many work lines must be processed and the worker can let that work be processed asynchronously. It's also useful when the server can have ad-hoc or unplanned increases in processing time, and the increased processing time might affect the user's productivity.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/deferred-put.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">Background processing is achieved by using the SysOperation framework. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamicsax-2012/developer/sysoperation-framework-overview" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/deferred-put.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">SysOperation Framework Overview</a>.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/deferred-put.md" sourcestartlinenumber="43">To use deferred processing, you must configure and use a work processing policy.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/deferred-put.md" sourcestartlinenumber="45">Policies are configured on the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/deferred-put.md" sourcestartlinenumber="45">Work processing policies</strong> page.

In this case, deferred processing is used if it can be used. If the specific threshold calculation is below the threshold, the Immediate method is used. Otherwise, the Deferred method is used if it can be used. For sales and transfer-related work, the threshold is calculated as the number of associated source load lines that are being processed for the work. For replenishment work, the threshold is calculated as the number of work lines that are being replenished by the work. By setting a threshold of, for example, <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/deferred-put.md" sourcestartlinenumber="53">5</strong> for sales, smaller works that have fewer than five initial source load lines won't use deferred processing, but larger works will use it.

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/deferred-put.md" sourcestartlinenumber="81">When deferred put processing is used, the closed work date is set as the created date/time of the deferred put processing tasks. The closed work date is used because it's the best estimate for when the put operation was completed.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/deferred-put.md" sourcestartlinenumber="85">You can reprocess a failed task by selecting it on the page and then selecting <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/deferred-put.md" sourcestartlinenumber="85">Process deferred put</strong>. Reprocessing corresponds to a situation where the user completes the put-away from the mobile device as if it was set for immediate processing.</p>
<h2 id="canceling-failed-tasks" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/deferred-put.md" sourcestartlinenumber="87">Canceling failed tasks</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/deferred-put.md" sourcestartlinenumber="89">Only failed tasks can be canceled. When you cancel a task, you can assign it to a new user. Alternatively, the task can remain assigned to the user who processed the work. Cancellation corresponds to a situation where the work is brought back to the mobile device as if the last pick step was just completed and the work must be put away. However, the user will be able to determine that the work is &quot;different,&quot; because it will have only a put-away step, and the location will correspond to the location that the first user who processed the work had as a final put location.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/deferred-put.md" sourcestartlinenumber="91">When a task is canceled, the work is no longer blocked by the deferred put processing blocking reason. It can be reprocessed by using the mobile device.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/deferred-put.md" sourcestartlinenumber="97">You can configure the mobile device menu item so that the deferred processing policy isn't used. The work is then processed as it is when no deferred processing policy is used. This functionality lets a supervisor use a specific menu item where deferred put isn't used. To configure it, set the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/deferred-put.md" sourcestartlinenumber="97">Deferred put processing policy</strong> field to <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/deferred-put.md" sourcestartlinenumber="97">Override settings and process put synchronously</strong>.</p>

<ul sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/deferred-put.md" sourcestartlinenumber="103">
