<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/submit-invoice-workflow-automatically.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">This topic explains the process of submitting vendor invoices to the workflow system and automatically matching posted product receipt lines to vendor invoices.</p>
<h2 id="submitting-imported-vendor-invoices-to-the-workflow-system-and-matching-posted-product-receipt-lines-to-pending-vendor-invoice-lines" sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/submit-invoice-workflow-automatically.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">Submitting imported vendor invoices to the workflow system and matching posted product receipt lines to pending vendor invoice lines</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/submit-invoice-workflow-automatically.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">As part of a touchless Accounts payable invoicing process, you can have the system automatically submit an imported invoice to the workflow system. You can configure the process of submitting imported invoices to the workflow system on the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/submit-invoice-workflow-automatically.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">Vendor invoice automation</strong> tab of the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/submit-invoice-workflow-automatically.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">Accounts payable parameters</strong> page (<strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/submit-invoice-workflow-automatically.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">Accounts payable &gt; Setup &gt; Accounts payable parameters</strong>). The submit-to-workflow process will run in the background, at a frequency that you specify (either hourly or daily).</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/submit-invoice-workflow-automatically.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">When you automatically submit invoices to the workflow system, you must begin with an imported invoice. To ensure that the invoice can be processed from start to finish without manual intervention, you must include an automated posting task in the workflow configuration. Invoices that are related to purchase orders (POs), and invoices that contain a non-PO procurement category and non-stocked lines, can automatically be submitted to the workflow system. Invoices that are manually entered must be manually submitted to the workflow system.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/submit-invoice-workflow-automatically.md" sourcestartlinenumber="48">As part of a touchless Accounts payable invoicing process, the system can automatically match posted product receipts to invoice lines. A three-way matching policy must be defined for this task. This feature is available if the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/submit-invoice-workflow-automatically.md" sourcestartlinenumber="48">Vendor invoice automation</strong> feature has been enabled on the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/submit-invoice-workflow-automatically.md" sourcestartlinenumber="48">Feature management</strong> page.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/submit-invoice-workflow-automatically.md" sourcestartlinenumber="50">The process will run until the matched product receipt quantity equals the invoice quantity. As part of this process, you can specify the maximum number of times that the system should try to match product receipts to an invoice line before it concludes that the process failed. The process will run in the background, either hourly or daily. You can run the automated matching process as part of the process for submitting invoices to the workflow system. Alternatively, you can run it as a standalone process. The settings for the match-product-receipts-to-invoice-lines process are configured on the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/submit-invoice-workflow-automatically.md" sourcestartlinenumber="50">Vendor invoice automation</strong> tab of the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/submit-invoice-workflow-automatically.md" sourcestartlinenumber="50">Accounts payable parameters</strong> page (<strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/submit-invoice-workflow-automatically.md" sourcestartlinenumber="50">Accounts payable &gt; Setup &gt; Accounts payable parameters</strong>).</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/submit-invoice-workflow-automatically.md" sourcestartlinenumber="52">Invoice lines that have a three-way matching policy, where the matched receipt quantity is less than the invoice quantity, will be included in the automated match-to-product-receipt process.</p>
