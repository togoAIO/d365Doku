The cut-off date determines the bank statement transactions and Operations bank transactions that are included on the reconciliation worksheet.

<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/reconcile-bank-statements-advanced-bank-reconciliation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="84">To manually match transactions, select the transactions in the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/reconcile-bank-statements-advanced-bank-reconciliation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="84">Bank statement transactions</strong> grid, select the corresponding transactions in the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/reconcile-bank-statements-advanced-bank-reconciliation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="84">Operations bank transactions</strong> grid, and then click <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/reconcile-bank-statements-advanced-bank-reconciliation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="84">Match</strong>. The selected transactions are moved from the upper grids for unmatched transactions to the lower grids for matched transactions. Additionally, the matched and unmatched total amounts are updated. You can have one-to-one, many-to-one, and many-to-many transaction matches. Matches must follow the rules for allowed date differences and transaction type mapping. These rules are set on the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/reconcile-bank-statements-advanced-bank-reconciliation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="84">Cash and bank management parameters</strong> page.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/reconcile-bank-statements-advanced-bank-reconciliation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="86">Penny differences might occur in your reconciliation. You can match a single bank statement transaction and a single Operations bank transaction that have penny differences if the penny differences are within the tolerance amount that is defined by the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/reconcile-bank-statements-advanced-bank-reconciliation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="86">Allowed penny difference</strong> field on the bank account.

<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/reconcile-bank-statements-advanced-bank-reconciliation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="88">Bank statement transaction reversals are matched by using the reconciliation worksheet. Two statement lines can be matched if the amounts are opposite, and if one of the transactions is marked as a reversal. You can also set up a matching rule for the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/reconcile-bank-statements-advanced-bank-reconciliation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="88">Clear reversal statement lines</strong> action.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/reconcile-bank-statements-advanced-bank-reconciliation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="90">Reversed Operations bank transactions must be reconciled by using the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/reconcile-bank-statements-advanced-bank-reconciliation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="90">Operations bank transactions</strong> page. You can reconcile two Operations bank transactions together if the documents have the same bank account, document type, and payment reference, and if they have opposite amounts. You can also reconcile a single canceled check to prevent those transactions from appearing on the reconciliation worksheet.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/reconcile-bank-statements-advanced-bank-reconciliation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="92">If there are new bank-initiated transactions, such as interest, fees, and charges, that aren’t yet in Finance, you can add them to a journal that is associated with the selected bank statement reconciliation.

The status of the transaction is set to <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/reconcile-bank-statements-advanced-bank-reconciliation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="92">New</strong>, and the transaction is moved to the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/reconcile-bank-statements-advanced-bank-reconciliation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="92">Bank statement transactions</strong> grid for matched transactions.

<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/reconcile-bank-statements-advanced-bank-reconciliation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="94">You can unmatch transactions that were incorrectly matched. Select the matched bank statement transaction, and then click <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/reconcile-bank-statements-advanced-bank-reconciliation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="94">Unmatch</strong>. All associated transactions are moved back to the upper grids for unmatched transactions, and the matched and unmatched total amounts are updated.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/reconcile-bank-statements-advanced-bank-reconciliation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="96">After completing your reconciliation process, you should mark the Bank reconciliation worksheet as reconciled.  This process will automatically post correction amounts using the accounts set on the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/reconcile-bank-statements-advanced-bank-reconciliation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="96">Bank transaction type</strong> page.  The bank reconciliation for a statement can be marked as reconciled at any time, even if there are bank statement lines that have not yet been matched.  The unmatched transactions will automatically move to the next reconciliation worksheet as unmatched bank statement transactions to be reconciled.  Note that once a bank statement reconciliation has been marked as reconciled, it cannot be undone.  The reconciliation will no longer be editable and you will no longer have the ability to make updates to that reconciliation.</p>
