<h1 id="release-product-structures">Release product structures</h1>


<p>To ensure that engineering-relevant product data can easily be reused in different legal entities, you can release complete product structures in addition to releasing products together with their engineering versions. Therefore, you can release multilevel bill of materials (BOM) structures together with the parent in a single release action. In this case, the BOM and the lower-level products are also released.</p>
<p>Engineering products are created and maintained by their engineering company in such way that they meet quality requirements as they are designed. Each operational company that manufactures a product needs the same product and underlying BOM. Depending on the production facility, the route might be created locally. In this case, you won't release a route together with the product. For legal entities that will sell the products but won't manufacture them, the BOM might not be required.</p>
<p>To make the process more efficient, all engineering-relevant data can be released to other operational companies at the same time. This data includes the product structure. During the release process, you can choose which part of the product data should be released.</p>
<p>For more information about engineering companies and operational companies, see <a href="engineering-org-data-ownership-rules.html">Engineering companies and data ownership rules</a>.</p>
<p>Note that you can release both standard products and engineering products together with the release product structure. During this process, the whole product structure will be released, even the BOM and route from the company that the products are being released in.</p>
<p>For an example of how to release a product, see <a href="engineering-scenarios.html#release">Release an engineering product to a local company</a></p>
<h2 id="released-data-for-a-product-when-the-release-product-structure-is-used">Released data for a product when the release product structure is used</h2>
<p>The following data is included in the release of engineering products:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product data</strong> – A new released product is created.</li>
<li><strong>Engineering version data</strong> – The engineering version and its data are created or updated. Note that if you release the same engineering version again to an operational company, the engineering data will be overwritten.</li>
<li><strong>Engineering attributes</strong> – The engineering attributes and their values are created or updated.</li>
<li><strong>Engineering bill of materials</strong> – The engineering BOM and its lines can be created or updated. For more information about data ownership, see <a href="product-owner.html">Product owners</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Engineering routes</strong> – The engineering routes and their operations can be created or updated. For more information about data ownership, see <a href="product-owner.html">Product owners</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Engineering documents</strong> – The engineering documents that are connected to the engineering version are created or updated.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you turn on engineering change management on your system, the release product structure is available. In addition, standard products will include their BOMs and routes when they are released.</p>
<h2 id="product-acceptance">Product acceptance</h2>
<p><strong>Product acceptance</strong> is a key parameter that influences the release process. You can set this parameter for each company by going to <strong>Engineering change management &gt; Setup &gt; Engineering change management parameters</strong>. For more information, see <a href="engineering-parameters.html">Engineering change management parameters</a>.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-product-acceptance">Automatic product acceptance</h3>
<p>Each release of engineering products starts when somebody from the engineering company selects a product to release. When the <strong>Product acceptance</strong> parameter is set to <em>Automatic</em>, the user at the engineering company decides which product data should be automatically released to the operational companies. The product will then automatically be released to the companies that are selected in the release wizard.</p>
<h3 id="manual-product-acceptance">Manual product acceptance</h3>
<p>Each release of engineering products starts when somebody from the engineering company selects a product to release. When the <strong>Product acceptance</strong> parameter is set to <em>Manual</em>, the user at the engineering company decides which product data should be released to the operational companies. A user from each operational company then reviews the product data and decides whether to accept the release. The user at the operational company can set the following options when the data is received:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the products (updates) aren't relevant for the operational company, the user can choose not to accept the release.</li>
<li>The user can change the item template for new products.</li>
<li>The user can choose whether the product should be released together with their BOMs and/or routes, and whether they should be released as approved and active.</li>
<li>The user can change the effective-from dates of the products.</li>
</ul>
<p>For an example of how to accept a product, see <a href="engineering-scenarios.html#accept">Review and accept the product before you release it in the local company</a>.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>For standard products, you can release from any legal entity to any other legal entity. For engineering products, the only legal entity that you can release from is the engineering company.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="release-policies">Release policies</h2>
<p>Not all operational companies need the same product data. In general, operational companies that manufacture engineering products require a BOM, whereas operational company that only sell engineering products don't require a BOM. You can use release policies to establish the parameters that are used for the release of products.</p>
<p>For engineering products, the release policy is assigned in the engineering product category, and the field is mandatory. For standard products, the policy is assigned to the shared product, and the field is optional.</p>
<p>For more information about engineering product categories, see <a href="engineering-versions-product-category.html">Engineering versions and engineering product categories</a>.</p>
<p>During the release process, you can influence the settings.</p>
<h2 id="create-and-manage-product-release-policies">Create and manage product release policies</h2>
<p>To work with product release policies, go to <strong>Engineering change management &gt; Setup &gt; product release policies</strong>. Then follow one of these steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>To create a new policy, select <strong>New</strong> on the Action Pane, and then set the fields as described in the following subsections.</li>
<li>To edit an existing policy, select it in the list pane, select <strong>Edit</strong> on the Action Pane, and then set the fields as described in the following subsections.</li>
<li>To delete an existing policy, select it in the list pane, select <strong>Edit</strong> on the Action Pane, and then, on the <strong>General</strong> FastTab, make sure that the <strong>Active</strong> option is set to <em>No</em>. Then select <strong>Delete</strong> on the Action Pane.</li>

<h3 id="review-each-product-when-you-release-it">Review each product when you release it</h3>
<p>When engineering products that have BOMs or routes are released, the parameters will be set to default values, as indicated in the release policy. As a user, you can influence this behavior on the releasing side when you use the release product structure.</p>
<p>To release engineering products, on the <strong>Released products</strong> page, select the products to release, and then select <strong>Release product structure</strong> to open the release wizard. The <strong>Select engineering products to release</strong> page shows the products. Select a single product, and then select <strong>Release details</strong> to review the release details for the product.</p>
<p>On the <strong>Release details</strong> page, you can change the value of the <strong>Receive BOM</strong>, <strong>Copy BOM approval</strong>, <strong>Copy BOM activation</strong>, <strong>Receive BOM</strong>, <strong>Copy route approval</strong> and <strong>Copy route activation</strong> fields. In the push-pull scenario, you can change the value of the same fields on the receiving side, provided that the BOM and route are released.</p>
<h2 id="product-owners-and-product-releases">Product owners and product releases</h2>
<p>Because product owners know which legal entities need their products, a product can be released only by the members of that product's product owner group. Other users can't release products that they don't own.</p>
<p>This behavior applies only when a product is directly selected for release. Products that are part of another product's structure via a BOM <em>can</em> be released by non-owner users when they release the parent product, provided that they own the parent product.</p>
<p>For example, product X is assigned to the <em>Design cabinets</em> product owner group. Product X is also part of the BOM of product Y, which is assigned to the <em>Design speakers</em> product owner group. If a user from the <em>Design speakers</em> product owner group releases product Y and its BOM, product X will be released together with product Y.</p>
