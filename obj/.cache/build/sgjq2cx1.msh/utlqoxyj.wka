<h1 id="requests-for-quotation-rfqs-overview" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="32">Requests for quotation (RFQs) overview</h1>


<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">This topic provides an overview of requests for quotation (RFQs). Organizations
issue RFQs when they want to receive competitive offers from several vendors for
the items or services that they must purchase. In an RFQ, you ask vendors to
provide the prices and delivery times for the item quantities that you specify.
You can also ask vendors to specify whether there are any incidental charges,
such as shipping costs, or any discounts for large orders or early payment of
the vendor invoice.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">The RFQ process consists of the following tasks:</p>
<ol sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="46">
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="46">Create and send an RFQ to one or more vendors.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="47">Receive and register bids (RFQ replies).</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="48">Transfer bids that you accept to a purchase order, purchase agreement, or purchase requisition.</li>
</ol>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="50">The following illustration shows an overview of the RFQ process.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="52"><a href="media/rfq-process.jpg" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="52"><img src="media/rfq-process-458x1024.jpg" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="52" alt="RFQ process"></a></p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="54">You can create an RFQ case from planned orders, from a purchase requisition, or
by manual entry. The RFQ case is the base document that you use to issue an RFQ
to each vendor.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="58">After you prepare the RFQ case and add vendors, select <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="58">Send</strong> (<strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="58">Send and
publish</strong> for public sector) on the RFQ case. An RFQ journal is generated for
each vendor that you sent the RFQ to. You can configure the Printing options for
the Send action so that it either prints a report for each vendor to an archive
or sends a report to each vendor's email address. In addition, you can use the
RFQ journal for each vendor to generate a report that you can send or resend to
the vendor later. You can also configure the Send action so that it generates a
reply sheet that the vendor can fill in.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="67">This topic covers the process for handling RFQs when vendor collaboration isn't
used. If your system is set up for vendor collaboration, vendors can enter bids
directly in Supply Chain Management. For more
information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/supply-chain/procurement/vendor-collaboration-work-customers-dynamics-365-operations" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Vendor collaboration with
customers</a> and <a href="vendor-collaboration-work-external-vendors.html" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="71">Vendor collaboration with external vendors</a>.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="73">If you must amend an RFQ after you send it, you can resend the RFQ to vendors
when you've finished by using the two amendment actions: Create and Finalize.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">When you receive bids by email, you can handle these bids from the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">Request for
quotations</strong> page.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="79">If a second iteration of a reply from a vendor is required, select <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="79">Return</strong> on
the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="80">Request for quotation</strong> page. The Return action generates a new journal
and a report that will be printed, archived, and sent according to your Printing
settings.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="84">If you added scoring criteria to your RFQ case, the RFQ will have a scoring
panel where you can enter the scores. The total scores will appear on the RFQ
and when you compare the replies on the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="86">Compare replies</strong> page. On the
<strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="87">Compare replies</strong> page, you can also compare other reply data, such as the
line price, delivery date, and total price.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="90">After you choose a bid or a number of lines in a bid, you can accept all or some
lines and reject the rest. Acceptance journals, rejection journals, and
corresponding reports are generated, and will be printed, archived, and sent
according to your Printing settings. When you accept a bid or specific lines in
a bid, either a purchase agreement or a purchase order is generated, or a
purchase requisition is updated, depending on the purchase type of the RFQ. You
can create a trade agreement that you can use later for any of the replies,
regardless of whether you accepted or rejected them.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="99">An RFQ case has two statuses: lowest and highest, you can view the status on the
list page for <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="100">All request for quotations</strong>. The lowest status is the least
advanced stage of any line in the RFQ case, and the highest status is the most
advanced stage of any line in the RFQ case. For example, say that an RFQ case
with three lines is sent to two vendors, so there are two RFQs each with three
lines. All lines are <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="104">Sent</strong>. Now a bid is entered from one of the vendors and
the RFQ lines get the status <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="105">Received</strong>. This means that out of the three
lines on the RFQ case, all of them are <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="106">Sent</strong> for one RFQ and <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="106">Received</strong> for
another RFQ. The lowest status will then be <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="107">Sent,</strong> and the highest status is
<strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="108">Received.</strong></p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="110">These statuses will be described in more detail later in this topic.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-rfq-functionality" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="112">Setting up RFQ functionality</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="114">Before you can create an RFQ case, you must set up RFQ information on the
<strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="115">Procurement and sourcing parameters</strong> page. When you create an RFQ case, you
can specify default values that are copied to the RFQ. You can specify the
following default values:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="119">
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="119">The purchase type of new RFQs: <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="119">Purchase order</strong> or <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="119">Purchase agreement</strong></li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="120">The expiration date and time offset from the day the RFQ case is created.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="121">Solicitation type, which may default a specific scoring method to the RFQ case.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="122">Delivery information and payment terms.</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="124">You can override these values for a specific RFQ case.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="126">You should also configure the amendment process. As part of this configuration,
you can turn on field locking. When field locking is turned on, a procurement
professional who wants to amend an RFQ must first select <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="128">Create</strong> in the
<strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="129">Amendment</strong> section of the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="129">Quotation</strong> tab on the RFQ case. Then, after the
RFQ case has been updated with the amendment, the procurement professional must
complete the process by selecting <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="131">Finalize</strong>. The Finalize action generates an
email that notifies the vendors about the amended RFQ.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="134">On the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="134">Procurement and sourcing parameters</strong> page, you select the template to
use for the email notification that is sent to vendors. When a template is
created in <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="136">Email templates</strong>, it can contain the following replacement
tokens:</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="148">The %Reason for bid return% and %Reason for amendment% tokens are replaced by
text that the procurement professional can enter when he or she completes the
amendment in the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="150">Amendment</strong> wizard. The values for the %Amendment prepared
by% and %Company% tokens are automatically taken from the RFQ. The %Date% token
is replaced by the current date.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="154">If you want to cancel an RFQ after it’s been sent, you can do that from the RFQ
case. For the cancellation, an email template is required to send the
cancellation notification to the vendor's contact persons. The template must be
selected on the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="157">Procurement and sourcing parameters</strong> page. When the template
is created, it can contain the following replacements tokens:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="160">

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="171">If you want to use reason codes on a bid to indicate why it was rejected or
accepted, you must set up reason codes on the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="172">Vendor reasons</strong> page.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="174">On the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="174">Form setup</strong> page in Procurement and sourcing, you can configure the

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="188">When you create an RFQ case of the type Purchase order and add an inventory item
to the RFQ, an inventory transaction is generated that has a receipt status of
<strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="190">Quotation receipt</strong>. Only RFQ case lines that have this status are considered
when you use a master plan to calculate supplies. If you want the master plan to

in the setup of master planning.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="195">A purchasing manager or agent can create and maintain solicitation types to suit
the organization's procurement requirements. Each solicitation type can be

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="272">Occasionally, you must change an RFQ case after you send it. You might have to
change an RFQ case if, for example, the delivery dates have changed, or you want
additional products or different quantities of products. You can configure the
amendment process so that it's either more restrictive or less restrictive.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="277">If you configure the amendment process so that it's more restrictive, before you
can modify the fields on an RFQ case that has already been sent, you must select
<strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="279">Create</strong> on the RFQ case to start an amendment. After you've completed your
changes, you must select <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="280">Finalize</strong>. You're then guided through the process of
adding information for the email that is sent to notify vendors about the
amendment. The updated RFQ report, which includes an amendment note, is
automatically attached to the email.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="285">If you configure the amendment process so that it's less restrictive, you don't
have to select <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="286">Create</strong> before you can modify the fields on an RFQ case that
has already been sent. However, you must manually add an amendment note on the
RFQ and send the case again. Be aware that this approach can be used only if
none of the replies (bids) have been edited. If you've entered a reply and it's
in a <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="290">Received</strong> state, the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="290">Send</strong> button is unavailable. In this case, you

restrictive process. The reply is then reset to reflect the changes to the RFQ
case.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations.md" sourcestartlinenumber="295">If vendors use the vendor collaboration interface to enter bids, you must always
use the amendment process to notify vendors about changes to the RFQ case. This
process helps prevent the situation where vendors bid on an outdated RFQ case
while their bid is in progress. For more information about vendor collaboration,
