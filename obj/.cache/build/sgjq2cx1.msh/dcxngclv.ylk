<p>Work order lifecycle states define the states that a work order can go through. Examples include <strong>Created</strong>, <strong>Scheduled</strong>, <strong>In progress</strong>, and <strong>Ended</strong>. Work order lifecycle states can be manually updated on a work order, or they can be automatically updated (for example, during work order scheduling).</p>
<p>The work order lifecycle states that are required for your work orders must be attached to matching project stages on the <strong>Project management and accounting parameters</strong> page (<strong>Project management and accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Project management and accounting parameters</strong>). You first set up project stages in Project management and accounting. You then set up work order lifecycle states and work order lifecycle models in Asset Management.</p>
<p>The following table describes the options in the <strong>Work order</strong> and <strong>Schedule</strong> sections on the <strong>General</strong> FastTab of the <strong>Work order lifecycle state</strong> page (<strong>Asset management</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Work orders</strong> &gt; <strong>Lifecycle states</strong>).</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Active</td>
<td>Set this option to <strong>Yes</strong> if the work order should be active while it's in this lifecycle state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Add line</td>
<td>Set this option to <strong>Yes</strong> if work order jobs can be added to a work order that is in this lifecycle state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Delete</td>
<td>Set this option to <strong>Yes</strong> if a work order can be deleted while it's in this lifecycle state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Delete line</td>
<td>Set this option to <strong>Yes</strong> if work order jobs can be deleted from a work order that is in this lifecycle state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Allow scheduling</td>
<td>Set this option to <strong>Yes</strong> if a work order can be scheduled while it's in this lifecycle state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Set actual start</td>
<td>Set this option to <strong>Yes</strong> if the user should be prompted to select an actual start date and time for a work order when it's updated to this lifecycle state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Set actual end</td>
<td>Set this option to <strong>Yes</strong> if the user should be prompted to select an actual end date and time for a work order when it's updated to this lifecycle state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Post journals</td>
<td>Set this option to <strong>Yes</strong> if work order journals should be automatically posted when a work order is updated to this lifecycle state. If an error occurs during journal posting, a message is shown, and the update of the work order lifecycle state is canceled. To view the journal lines for a work order, select <strong>Asset management</strong> &gt; <strong>Common</strong> &gt; <strong>Work orders</strong> &gt; <strong>All work orders</strong>, <strong>Active work orders</strong>, or <strong>My active work orders</strong>, select the work order in the list, and then select <strong>Journals</strong>. This setup of automatic work order journal posting at a specific lifecycle state is the same as when you select <strong>Post journals</strong> on the <strong>Work order journals</strong> page.<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you set this option to <strong>Yes</strong>, journals are automatically posted if no approval workflow has been set up. If your company uses the journal approval setup that is configured on the <strong>Journal approval</strong> page (<strong>Project management and accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Journals</strong> &gt; <strong>Journal approval</strong>), a manager or clerk must validate and post consumption registrations.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Process maintenance checklist</td>
<td>Set this option to <strong>Yes</strong> if all attached maintenance checklists should be processed when a work order is updated to this lifecycle state. As part of this processing, any counter registrations that were made on a maintenance checklist are posted, and the result of the whole maintenance checklist is evaluated. Maintenance checklist lines that have <strong>Pass</strong> and <strong>Fail</strong> results are evaluated, and if at least one line fails, the whole maintenance checklist is marked as <strong>Failed</strong> in Asset Management.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ready</td>
<td>Set this option to <strong>Yes</strong> if the work order job schedule status for all work order jobs that are created on a work order should automatically be updated to <strong>Ready</strong> when the work order is updated to this lifecycle state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Start</td>
<td>Set this option to <strong>Yes</strong> if the work order job schedule status for all work order jobs that are created on a work order should automatically be updated to <strong>Started</strong> when the work order is updated to this lifecycle state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>End</td>
<td>Set this option to <strong>Yes</strong> if the work order job schedule status for all work order jobs that are created on a work order should automatically be updated to <strong>Ended</strong> when the work order is updated to this lifecycle state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Delete schedule lines</td>
<td>Set this option to <strong>Yes</strong> if scheduling on all work order jobs that are created on a work order that has already been scheduled should be deleted when the work order is updated to this lifecycle state. In other words, capacity reservations on the asset, the related maintenance worker, and related tools will be deleted. For example, you set this option to <strong>Yes</strong> on a work order lifecycle state that is named <strong>Estimated</strong>. Then, when a work order is rolled back to this lifecycle state because rescheduling is required, scheduling can be deleted on that work order.</td>

<h5>Note</h5>
<p>If the lifecycle state that you update a work order to is inactive, journals that are related to the work order but that haven't yet been posted are automatically deleted. This behavior helps guarantee automatic cleanup of unused data. (A lifecycle state is inactive if the <strong>Active</strong> option for it is set to <strong>No</strong> on the <strong>General</strong> FastTab of the <strong>Work order lifecycle state</strong> page.)</p>
<p>However, if you manually set a work order so that it's inactive, journals that are related to the work order but that haven't yet been posted are <strong>not</strong> automatically deleted. (To manually inactivate a work order, select <strong>Asset management</strong> &gt; <strong>Common</strong> &gt; <strong>Work orders</strong> &gt; <strong>All work orders</strong> or <strong>Active work orders</strong>. Open the work order, and switch to the <strong>Header</strong> view. On the <strong>General</strong> FastTab, select <strong>Edit</strong>, and then set the <strong>Active</strong> option to <strong>No</strong>.)</p>

<h2 id="relations-among-work-order-lifecycle-models-work-order-types-and-work-order-lifecycle-states">Relations among work order lifecycle models, work order types, and work order lifecycle states</h2>
<p>Lifecycle models refer to workflows, and lifecycle states are selected in a lifecycle model in sequential order. Lifecycle models are set up on work order types. Work order types determine the size or extent of workflows and work processes. For example, <strong>Maintenance</strong>, which is a standard work order type, might be related to a work order lifecycle model that has many lifecycle states. By contrast, you might have a <strong>Corrective</strong> work order type that is used for work orders that haven't been scheduled, or for work orders where the job is completed before the work order is made because of an urgent situation. This work order type might be related to a work order lifecycle model that has only a few lifecycle states.</p>
<p>The reason for using types is that when a type is defined on, for example, a work order or an asset, the related work processes (lifecycle states) are automatically defined. For more information about how to set up work order types, see <a href="work-order-types.html">Work order types</a>.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Lifecycle states, lifecycle models, and types apply to functional locations, assets, and maintenance requests, in addition to work orders.</p>
</div>
<p>The following illustration shows the relation between work order types, lifecycle models, and lifecycle states.</p>
<p><img src="media/11-setup-for-work-orders.png" alt="Work order type page compared to Work order lifectyle models page"></p>
<h2 id="work-order-lifecycle-models">Work order lifecycle models</h2>
<p>After you've created the work order lifecycle states that are required for your work orders, they can be divided into work order lifecycle models. At a minimum, you should create one standard lifecycle model.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Select <strong>Asset management</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Work orders</strong> &gt; <strong>Lifecycle models</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>New</strong> to create a work order lifecycle model.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Lifecycle model</strong> field, enter an ID for the lifecycle model.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Name</strong> field, enter a name.</p>
<p>On the <strong>Details</strong> FastTab, the <strong>Lifecycle states</strong> field shows the number of lifecycle states that are selected in this lifecycle model. The <strong>Work order types</strong> field shows the number of work order types that use this lifecycle model.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Lifecycle states</strong> FastTab, select the lifecycle states that should be included in the lifecycle model:</p>
<ul>
<li>To include a lifecycle state in the lifecycle model, select it in the <strong>Lifecycle states remaining</strong> section, and then select the right arrow button <img src="media/12-setup-for-work-orders.png" alt="Right arrow"> to move it to the <strong>Lifecycle states selected</strong> section.</li>
<li>To include all the available lifecycle states in the lifecycle model, select the <strong>Select all available stages</strong> button <img src="media/13-setup-for-work-orders.png" alt="Select all available stages">. All lifecycle states are moved to the <strong>Lifecycle states selected</strong> section.</li>
<li>To remove a lifecycle state from the lifecycle model, select it in the <strong>Lifecycle states selected</strong> section, and then select the left arrow button <img src="media/14-setup-for-work-orders.png" alt="Left arrow"> to move it to the <strong>Lifecycle states remaining</strong> section.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Lifecycle state updates</strong> to define the lifecycle states that can follow a selected lifecycle state.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Updates</strong> FastTab, in the <strong>Scheduled state</strong> field, select the lifecycle state that should always be selected for a work order that you've completed work order scheduling for, regardless of the previous lifecycle state of the work order.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Unscheduled lifecycle state</strong> field, select the lifecycle state that should always be selected for a work order if work order scheduling is deleted.</p>
