<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">When an inventory reservation hierarchy of the &quot;Batch-below[location]&quot; type is associated with products, businesses that sell batch-tracked products and run their logistics as operations that are enabled for the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Warehouse Management System (WMS) can't reserve specific batches of those products for customer sales orders.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">In a similar way, specific license plates can't be reserved for products on sales orders when those products are associated with the default reservation hierarchy.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">This topic describes the inventory reservation policy that lets these businesses reserve specific batches or license plates, even when the products are associated with a &quot;Batch-below[location]&quot; reservation hierarchy.</p>
<h2 id="inventory-reservation-hierarchy" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">Inventory reservation hierarchy</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">This section summarizes the existing inventory reservation hierarchy.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="46">The inventory reservation hierarchy dictates that, as far as storage dimensions are concerned, the demand order carries the mandatory dimensions of site, warehouse, and inventory status, whereas the warehouse logic is responsible for assigning a location to the requested quantities and reserving the location. In other words, in the interactions between the demand order and the warehouse operations, the demand order is expected to indicate where the order must be shipped from (that is, what site and warehouse). The warehouse then relies on its logic to find the required quantity in the warehouse premises.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="48">However, to reflect the operational model of the business, tracking dimensions (batch and serial numbers) are subject to more flexibility. An inventory reservation hierarchy can accommodate scenarios where the following conditions apply:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="50">
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="50">The business relies on its warehouse operations to manage picking of quantities that have batch or serial numbers after the quantities have been found in the warehousing storage space. This model is often referred to as <em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="50">Batch-below[location]</em>. It's typically used when a product's batch or serial number identification isn't important to the customers who place the demand with the selling company.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="51">If batch or serial numbers are part of a customer's order specification, and they are recorded on the demand order, the warehouse operations that find the quantities in the warehouse are constrained by the specific requested numbers and aren't allowed to change them. This model is referred to as <em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="51">Batch-above[location]</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="53">In these scenarios, the challenge is that only one inventory reservation hierarchy can be assigned to each released product. Therefore, for the WMS to handle tracked items, after the hierarchy assignment determines when the batch or serial number should be reserved (either when the demand order is taken or during the warehouse picking work), this timing can't be changed on an ad-hoc basis.</p>
<h2 id="flexible-reservation-for-batch-tracked-items" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="55">Flexible reservation for batch-tracked items</h2>
<h3 id="business-scenario" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="57">Business scenario</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="59">In this scenario, a company uses an inventory strategy where finished goods are tracked by batch numbers. This company also uses the WMS workload. Because this workload has well-equipped logic for planning and running warehouse picking and shipping operations for batch-enabled items, most of the finished items are associated with a &quot;Batch-below[location]&quot; inventory reservation hierarchy. The advantage of this type of operational setup is that decisions (which are effectively reservation decisions) about which batches to pick and where to put them in the warehouse are postponed until the warehouse picking operations start. They aren't made when the customer's order is placed.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="61">Although the &quot;Batch-below[location]&quot; reservation hierarchy serves the company's business goals well, many of the company's established customers require the same batch that they previously purchased when they reorder products. Therefore, the company is looking for flexibility in the way that the batch reservation rules are handled, so that, depending on the customers' demand for the same item, the following behaviors occur:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="63">
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="63">A batch number can be recorded and reserved when the order is taken by the sales processor, and it can't be changed during warehouse operations and/or taken by other demands. This behavior helps guarantee that the batch number that was ordered is shipped to the customer.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">If the batch number isn't important to the customer, the warehouse operations can determine a batch number during picking work, after sales order registration and reservation have been done.</li>

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">To accommodate the desired flexibility in the batch reservation behavior for items that are associated with a &quot;Batch-below[location]&quot; inventory reservation hierarchy, inventory managers must select the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">Allow reservation on demand order</strong> check box for the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">Batch number</strong> level on the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">Inventory reservation hierarchies</strong> page.</p>

(By default, all dimensions above the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="72">Location</strong> level are preselected.)

By contrast, on the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="152">Overview</strong> FastTab, regular order line reservation (that is, reservation that is done for the dimensions above the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="152">Location</strong> level) is shown in the grid up to the point when warehouse work is created.

<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="153">In addition to reserving a specific batch, a user can manually select the batch's specific location and license plate instead of letting the system automatically select them. This capability is related to the design of the order-committed batch reservation mechanism. As was mentioned earlier, when a batch number is reserved for an item under the &quot;Batch-below[location]&quot; reservation policy, the system must reserve all dimensions up through location. Therefore, warehouse work will carry the same storage dimensions that were reserved by the users who worked with the orders, and it might not always represent the item storage placement that is convenient, or even possible, for picking operations. If order processors are aware of the warehouse constraints, they might want to manually select the specific locations and license plates when they reserve a batch. In this case, the user must use the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="153">Display dimensions</strong> functionality on the page header, and must add the location and license plate in the grid on the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="153">Overview</strong> FastTab.</li>

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="160">Reservation of the quantity on a sales order line can be done across multiple batches.

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="162">Reservation of a specific batch for the quantity on a sales order line can also be partial. For example, the total quantity of 100 units can be reserved so that a specific batch is committed to 20 units, whereas 80 units are reserved at the site and warehouse levels for any available batch. In this case, the WMS will handle picking operations by using two separate work lines.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="374">Warehouse work for picking order-committed batch numbers is subject to the same standard warehouse exception handling and actions as regular work. In general, the open work or work line can be canceled, it can be interrupted because a user location is full, it can be short-picked, and it can be updated because of a movement. Likewise, the picked quantity of work that has already been completed can be reduced, or the work can be reversed.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/flexible-warehouse-level-dimension-reservation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="376">The following key rule is applied to all these exception handling actions: the batch number that was reserved for the customer can never be replaced with a different batch number, but its storage dimensions (location and license plate) can be changed through either a manual update by the user or an automatic update by the system.
