<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">When you work with inventory in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce and use any of the Commerce applications that are connected to a Commerce Scale Unit (CSU), it's important to know that the order processing logic in CSU provides limited support for some inventory dimensions and some inventory item types. Commerce applications don't support the full range of item configuration capabilities that is available through the item configuration options in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">The Commerce applications running on CSU don't support the following product dimensions and item configurations:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">
<li sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">Configuration product dimension and bill of materials (BOM) items (except retail kit products, which use some components of the BOM framework)</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">Catch weight items</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">Version product dimension-controlled items</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">The Commerce applications running on CSU do not support the following tracking dimensions:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="45">
<li sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="45"><p sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="45">Owner dimension</p>

POS may automatically enter some of the dimensions in inventory transactions, based on the configuration of the warehouse or store setup. POS won't fully support the dimensions in the way that they are supported if a sales transaction is manually entered in Commerce headquarters, however.</p>

If they use the obsolete <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="49">Picking and receiving</strong> operation, limited location management support is available for receiving and shipping outbound transfers. That support is available only if the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="49">Use warehouse management process</strong> option has been turned on for the item and the store warehouse.

POS users can't change or manage this license plate data. If full management of license plates is required, we recommend that the store use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/supply-chain/warehousing/install-configure-warehousing-app" sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="51">warehousing app</a> or the back-office client to manage the receipt of these items.</p>

This serial number isn't validated against registered serial numbers that are already in inventory. If a sales order is created in the call center channel or fulfilled through enterprise resource planning (ERP), and multiple serial numbers are registered on a single sales line during the fulfillment process in ERP, those serial numbers can't be applied or validated if a return is processed for the order in POS. When inventory is received by using the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="53">Inbound operation</strong> operation, users can <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/commerce/pos-serialized-items" sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="53">register or confirm the serial numbers received</a>.</p>

<div class="NOTE" sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="59">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="60">All organizations must test item configurations through Commerce apps in development or test environments before they deploy those item configurations to production environments. Test your items by using them to perform regular cash-and-carry sales transactions in POS and create customer orders (if applicable) through POS, call center or e-commerce to validate they can be fully supported. You should also test POS fulfillment and inventory processes (such as inventory receiving and order fulfillment operations) before you deploy any new item configurations, to make sure that the POS application can support them. Testing must include running a full statement/order posting process in your test environment and verifying that no posting issues occur when orders for these items are created and posted in Commerce headquarters.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="62">If items are configured in a way that isn't supported by the Commerce applications and appropriate testing isn't done, data failures that aren't easily corrected or may not be able to be corrected at all, may occur.</p>

<h2 id="purchase-orders" sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">Purchase orders</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">Purchase orders are created in Commerce headquarters. If a store warehouse is included in the purchase order header or on purchase order lines, the lines can be received at the store by using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation" sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">Inbound operation</a> operation in POS.</p>
<h2 id="transfer-orders" sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">Transfer orders</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Transfer orders can be created in Commerce headquarters, or through either the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/commerce/pos-inbound-inventory-operation" sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Inbound operation</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/commerce/pos-outbound-inventory-operation" sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Outbound operation</a> operation in POS. Use the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Inbound operation</strong> POS operation to create a transfer order request to have inventory sent to the store from another warehouse or store location. Use the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Outbound operation</strong> POS operation to create a transfer order request to have inventory shipped from the store to another warehouse or store location. After a transfer order for a store is created, that store can manage the receipt of inventory for the transfer order through the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Inbound operation</strong> operation in POS. If the store is shipping inventory to another location, the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Outbound operation</strong> operation in POS is used to manage that store's outbound shipment process.</p>
<h2 id="stock-counts" sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="72">Stock counts</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">Stock counts can be either scheduled or unscheduled. Scheduled stock counts are created through Commerce headquarters by creating a Counting journal document that is linked to the store's warehouse. This journal specifies the items that must be counted. The store can then access these predefined counting journals and act on them by using the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">Stock count</strong> operation in POS. Store users initiate an unscheduled stock count as it's required when they use the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">Stock count</strong> operation in POS. Unlike scheduled stock counts, unscheduled stock counts don't have a predefined list of items. When a stock count of either type is completed in POS, it's committed and sent to the head office. At the head office, the count must then be validated and posted in Commerce headquarters as a separate step.</p>
<h2 id="inventory-lookup" sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">Inventory lookup</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="78">The product quantity that is currently on hand for multiple stores and warehouses can be viewed on the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="78">Inventory lookup</strong> page. In addition to the current on-hand quantity, the future available-to-promise (ATP) quantities can be viewed for each store. Select the store to view the ATP quantities for, and then select <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/work-with-store-inventory.md" sourcestartlinenumber="78">Show store availability</strong>.
