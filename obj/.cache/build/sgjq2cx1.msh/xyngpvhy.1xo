<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="37">Weighted average date is an inventory model that is based on the weighted average principle. For the weighted average principle, issues from inventory are valued at the average value of the items that are received into inventory for each day in the inventory closing period.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">When you run an inventory closing by using weighted average date, all daily receipts are settled against a virtual issue. This virtual issue holds the total received quantity and value for that day. The virtual issue has a corresponding virtual receipt that the issues will be settled against. Therefore, all issues receive the same average cost. The virtual issue and virtual receipt can be considered a virtual transfer that is known as the <em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">weighted average inventory closing transfer</em>.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">If only one receipt has occurred on or before the date, you don't have to value the average. Because all issues are settled from that receipt, the virtual transfer won't be created. Likewise, if only issues occur on the date, there are no receipts to value the average from, and the virtual transfer won't be created. When you use weighted average date, you can mark inventory transactions so that a specific item receipt is settled against a specific issue. In this case, you don't use the weighted average date rule. We recommend a monthly inventory closing when you use the weighted average date inventory model.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="43">The following formula is used to calculate the weighted average date costing method:</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="45">Weighted average = ([Q1 × P1] + [Q2 × P2] + [Q<em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="45">n</em> × P<em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="45">n</em>]) ÷ (Q1 + Q2 + Q<em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="45">n</em>)</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="47">During inventory close, the calculation is performed every day through the closing period, as shown in the following illustration.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="49"><img src="media/weightedaveragedatedailycalculationmodel.gif" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="49" alt="Weighted average date daily calculation model"></p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="51">Inventory transactions that leave the inventory, such as sales orders, inventory journals, and production orders, occur at an estimated cost price on the date of posting. This estimated cost price is also referred to as the running average cost price. On the date of inventory close, the system analyzes the inventory transactions for previous periods, previous days, and the current day. This analysis is used to determine which of the following closing principles should be used:</p>

</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="56">Settlements are inventory close postings that adjust the issues to the correct weighted average as of the closing date.</p>

<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="156">One receipt and one or several issues have been posted in the period.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="157">Only issues have been posted in the period, and the inventory contains on-hand inventory from a previous closing.</li>
</ul>

Issues are posted based on this estimated cost price during the period. During the inventory close, only financially updated receipts will be considered in the weighted average calculation.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="162">If you select the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="162">Include physical value</strong> check box for an item on the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="162">Item model group</strong> page, the system uses physically updated receipts when it calculates the estimated cost price, or running average. Issues are posted based on this estimated cost price during the period. During the inventory close, only financially updated receipts will be considered in the weighted average calculation. Weighted average settlement is based on the principle that receipts in a closing period are summarized into a new inventory transfer transaction that is known as <em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="162">weighted average inventory closing</em>. All the receipts for the day are settled against the issue of the newly created inventory transfer transaction. All issues for the day are settled against the receipt of the new inventory transfer transaction. If the on-hand inventory is positive after the inventory close, that on-hand inventory and the value of the inventory are summarized on the new inventory transfer transaction (receipt). If the on-hand inventory is negative after the inventory close, the on-hand inventory and the value of the inventory are the sum of individual issues that haven't been fully settled.</p>
<h2 id="weighted-average-date-when-marking-is-used" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="164">Weighted average date when marking is used</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="165">Marking is a process that lets you link an issue transaction to a receipt transaction. Marking can occur either before or after a transaction is posted. You can use marking when you want to be sure of the exact cost of the inventory when the transaction is posted or when the inventory close is performed.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="167">For example, your Customer Service department accepted a rush order from an important customer. Because this is a rush order, you will have to pay more for this item to meet your customer’s request. You must make certain that the cost of this inventory item is reflected in the margin, or cost of goods sold (COGS), for this sales order invoice. When the purchase order is posted, the inventory is received at a cost of USD 120.00. The sales order document is marked to the purchase order before the packing slip or invoice is posted. The COGS will then be USD 120.00 instead of the current running average cost for the item. If the sales order packing slip or invoice is posted before the marking occurs, the COGS will be posted at the running average cost price. Before inventory close is performed, these two transactions can still be marked to each other. When a receipt transaction is marked to an issue transaction, the valuation method that is defined in the item’s item model group will be disregarded. Instead, the system settles these transactions to each other.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="169">You can mark an issue transaction to a receipt before the transaction is posted. You can do this from a sales order line on the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="169">Sales order details</strong> page. You can view the open receipt transactions on the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/weighted-average-date.md" sourcestartlinenumber="169">Marking</strong> page. You can mark an issue transaction to a receipt after the transaction is posted. You can match or mark an issue transaction for an open receipt transaction for an inventoried item from a posted inventory adjustment journal. The following illustration shows these transactions:</p>
