<h3 id="credit-management-checkpoint" sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/cm-credit-mgmt-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="55">Credit management checkpoint</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/cm-credit-mgmt-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="57">You can set the timing that is used to check sales orders for credit issues. The <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/cm-credit-mgmt-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="57">Credit management checkpoint</strong> FastTab identifies the document posting processes that include processing of credit management rules. You can also check the credit rules while you do either a pro-forma posting or a full posting of the sales order. Select the check boxes to define the posting processes that should put an order on hold if an issue is found after the credit management blocking rules are processed.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/cm-credit-mgmt-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="59">You can also define the number of grace days before the credit rules are checked again. Although you can specify that the credit management rules are checked at posting, the rules won't be checked for the specified number of grace days. For example, you confirm a sales order on day 1, and you specify two grace days for the confirmation step. In this case, credit rules won't be checked at the next posting step (for example, creation of a packing slip or invoicing of the order) until day 4. On or after day 4, the rules will be checked again when posting occurs, and the number of grace days will be changed to the value that is specified for the next posting checkpoint.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/cm-credit-mgmt-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="61">If you don't specify the number of grace days, the credit rules will be checked at every posting step that is set up to run credit management rules. If you release the sales order without posting and then run the same order processing step again, the credit rules will be checked again. For example, an order is put on hold after a confirmation, and you release it either with or without posting. In this case, the order will be put on hold again if you confirm it again. Use grace days if the order should move on to the next processing step without being held again.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/cm-credit-mgmt-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="63">You can't specify grace days for some posting checkpoints but not for others. You must set up all posting checkpoints so that they have grace days, or you must set them all up so that they don't have grace days.</p>
