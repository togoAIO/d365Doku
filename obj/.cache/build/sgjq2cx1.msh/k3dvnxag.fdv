<p sourcefile="articles/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/hr/localizations/noam-usa-premium-earning-setup-tasks.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">This topic provides information about premium earnings and how to set them up. Premium earnings are extra earnings, such as bonuses or overtime premiums, that are paid to workers when specific conditions are met. Other types of premium earnings include a differential for hours that are worked on a second or third shift, and additional pay for workers who hold a certificate for advanced training or qualifications.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/hr/localizations/noam-usa-premium-earning-setup-tasks.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">To set up and pay simple premiums, such as annual bonuses, you just have to create an earning code for the premium. Then, when it's time to pay the premium, you add the earning code to earnings statements. For more information, see <a href="noam-usa-earning-code-group-tasks.html" sourcefile="articles/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/hr/localizations/noam-usa-premium-earning-setup-tasks.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">Set up earning codes and earning code groups</a>. Other premiums are based on other earnings, or on characteristics of the worker or position. This topic explains how to set up the more complex types of premiums that are supported.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/hr/localizations/noam-usa-premium-earning-setup-tasks.md" sourcestartlinenumber="100">These premiums are used for shift differentials and similar premiums that should be paid any time that specified earning codes are included on an earnings statement.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/hr/localizations/noam-usa-premium-earning-setup-tasks.md" sourcestartlinenumber="102">Before you create the premium earning codes, review the earning codes that were created during the basic Payroll setup process, to make sure that all earning codes that qualify for premiums have been created. For example, your company pays a premium for hours that are worked on the second shift. Earnings for the first shift and the second shift are identical, but only the hours that are worked on the second shift qualify for the premium. In this case, to correctly apply the premium, you must have separate earning codes for first-shift earnings and second-shift earnings. If you require additional earning codes, you can create them before you continue to create premium policies and codes. Be sure to add those earning codes to the earning code group that was created for regular-rate-of-pay premiums.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/hr/localizations/noam-usa-premium-earning-setup-tasks.md" sourcestartlinenumber="104">If your company pays a differential for work on the second and third shifts, the premium might differ for union workers and non-union workers. In this case, you must have four earning codes. Therefore, you must identify all the various premiums that your organization pays. You must then identify which of those premiums are based on other earnings.</p>
