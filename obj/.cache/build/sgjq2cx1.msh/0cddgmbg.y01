<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/faq-year-end-activities.md" sourcestartlinenumber="61">You can make a number of changes to improve performance of the year-end close.

<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/faq-year-end-activities.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">When running the year end close, each dimension set balance is rebuilt, having a direct impact on the performance. Some organizations create dimension sets unnecessarily because they were used at one point or might be used at some point.  These unnecessary dimension sets are still rebuilt during the year end close, which adds time to the process. Take time to evaluate your dimension sets and delete any unnecessary dimension sets.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/faq-year-end-activities.md" sourcestartlinenumber="71">The year-end close template lets organizations select the financial dimension level to maintain when transferring profit and loss balances to retained earnings. The settings allow an organization to maintain the detailed financial dimensions (<strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/faq-year-end-activities.md" sourcestartlinenumber="71">Close all</strong>) when moving the balances to retained earnings or choose to summarize the amounts to a single dimension value (<strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/faq-year-end-activities.md" sourcestartlinenumber="71">Close single</strong>). This can be defined for each financial dimension. For more information on these settings, see the <a href="year-end-close.html" sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/faq-year-end-activities.md" sourcestartlinenumber="71">Year-end close</a> topic.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/faq-year-end-activities.md" sourcestartlinenumber="73">We recommend that you evaluate your organization's requirements and if possible, close as many dimensions as possible using the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/faq-year-end-activities.md" sourcestartlinenumber="73">Close single</strong> year-end option to improve performance. By closing to a single dimension value (which can also be a blank value), the system calculates less detail when determining the balances for retained earnings account entries.

<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/faq-year-end-activities.md" sourcestartlinenumber="80">A new feature added in version 10.0.16 improves the performance of the year-end close and consolidation processes. The feature is named, Performance improvements for rebuilding financial dimension sets. This feature changes the way dimension sets are rebuilt so that they are rebuilt only for a relevant time frame. In the previous versions, dimension sets were rebuilt for all dates. For example, if you're closing the year 2020, the system will only rebuild the balances for transactions within the fiscal year 2020. If you're running consolidation for a date range of November 1, 2020 to November 30, 2020, the system will only rebuild the balances for that date range.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/faq-year-end-activities.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">Because this feature is considered a breaking change, you'll need to enable it using the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/faq-year-end-activities.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">Feature management</strong> workspace.</p>
