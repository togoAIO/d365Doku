<h1 id="fiscal-registration-service-integration-sample-for-germany">Fiscal registration service integration sample for Germany</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>To meet local fiscal requirements for cash registers in Germany, the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce functionality for Germany includes a sample integration of the point of sale (POS) with an external fiscal registration service. The sample extends the <a href="fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.html">fiscal integration functionality</a>. It's based on the <a href="https://www.efsta.eu/de/fiskalloesungen/deutschland">EFR (Electronic Fiscal Register)</a> solution from <a href="https://www.efsta.eu/de/">EFSTA</a> and enables communication with the EFR service via the HTTPS protocol. The EFR service should be hosted on either the Retail Hardware station or a separate computer that can be connected to from the Hardware station. The sample is provided in the form of source code and is part of the Retail software development kit (SDK).</p>
<p>Microsoft doesn't release any hardware, software, or documentation from EFSTA. For information about how to get the EFR solution and operate it, contact <a href="https://www.efsta.eu/de/kontakt/kontakt">EFSTA</a>.</p>
<h2 id="scenarios">Scenarios</h2>
<p>The following scenarios are covered by the fiscal registration service integration sample for Germany.</p>
<h3 id="sales-operations">Sales operations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Registration of cash-and-carry sales and returns in the fiscal registration service:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Registration of sales operations includes the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Registration of the transaction start</li>
</ol>
<p>The start of each transaction is registered in a technical security element (TSE) that is connected to the EFR service. As a result of    registration a TSE assigns a transaction ID (TID).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Registration of the transaction end</li>
</ol>
<p>When a transaction is concluded at the POS, it's registered by using the same TID that was assigned during registration of the transaction start. At that moment, detailed transaction data is sent to the fiscal registration service. This data includes sales line information, and information about discounts, payments, and taxes.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Capturing a response from the fiscal registration service</li>
</ol>
<p>Security data is received from a TSE as a part of a response and is saved in the transaction in the channel database. The security data consist of the following information:
- TID
- Date and time of the transaction start
- Date and time of the transaction end
- Signature counter
- Check value
- Serial number of the TSE</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Registration of customer orders in the fiscal registration service:</strong> The registration process is the same as the process for cash-and-carry sales and returns.</li>
<li><strong>Registration of operations that involve gift cards and deposits:</strong> The registration process is the same as the process for cash-and-carry sales and returns.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="notifying-users-about-fiscal-registration-failures">Notifying users about fiscal registration failures</h4>
<p>There are two ways that the fiscal registration service can notify users about failures that occurred during the fiscal registration:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Print additional information from the response in the <strong>Info message</strong> field on receipts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Show notifications from the fiscal service as user messages at the POS.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>This notification mechanism requires that the <strong>Show fiscal registration notifications</strong> parameter on the <strong>Connector technical profiles</strong> page be turned on.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="printing-receipts">Printing receipts</h4>
<p>Receipt printing is mandatory in Germany. All receipts must contain at least the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Name and address of the company</p>
</li>
<li><p>Information about goods, including their prices and quantities</p>
</li>
<li><p>Information about payments that were received</p>
</li>
<li><p>Information about taxes, including total amounts per tax rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Security data:</p>
<ul>
<li>TID</li>
<li>Date and time of the transaction start</li>
<li>Date and time of the transaction end</li>
<li>Signature counter</li>
<li>Check value</li>
<li>Serial number of the TSE</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Informational message</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>A QR code can also be printed on receipts. Although the QR code is optional, it's highly recommended. For more information about how to get QR code as a part of a response from the fiscal registration service, see the &quot;EFR Guide [DE]&quot; document that is published on the <a href="https://public.efsta.net/efr/">EFSTA documentation</a> website.</p>
<p>The <strong>Info message</strong> field on receipts shows a notification from the fiscal registration service. For example, if a signature device is broken, special text can be printed on a receipt.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="voided-suspended-and-recalled-transactions">Voided, suspended, and recalled transactions</h4>
<ul>
<li>A voided transaction is registered as a request to terminate a transaction in the fiscal registration service.</li>
<li>A suspended transaction is registered as a request to terminate a transaction in the fiscal registration service.</li>
<li>Recall of a suspended transaction is registered as the start of a new transaction in the fiscal registration service.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="non-sales-transactions-and-shift-closing">Non-sales transactions and shift closing</h3>
<p>The following non-sales transactions are registered as non-fiscal operations in the fiscal registration service by using the <strong>NFS</strong> tag:</p>
<ul>
<li>Declare start amount</li>
<li>Float entry</li>
<li>Tender removal</li>
<li>Safe drop</li>
<li>Bank drop</li>
<li>Income accounts</li>
<li>Expense accounts</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Close shift</strong> operation is also registered as a non-fiscal operation in the fiscal registration service by using the <strong>NFS</strong> tag.</p>
<h3 id="data-export-and-audit">Data export and audit</h3>
<p>All transactions must be signed by a TSE to ensure their integrity, authenticity, and completeness, and to help prevent manipulation of recorded data.</p>
<div class="WARNING">
<h5>Warning</h5>
<p>Only a certified TSE can be used. For information about the types and models of TSEs that are supported in the EFR solution, see the &quot;EFR Guide [DE]&quot; document that is published on the <a href="https://public.efsta.net/efr/">EFSTA documentation</a> website. For information about how to choose and obtain a TSE, contact <a href="https://www.efsta.eu/at/kontakt">EFSTA</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Regulations in Germany require support for the DSFinV-K export. The DSFinV-K export can be triggered in the EFR solution. For more information about the DSFinV-K export, see the &quot;EFR Guide [DE]&quot; document that is published on the <a href="https://public.efsta.net/efr/">EFSTA documentation</a> web-site.</p>
<h3 id="default-data-mapping">Default data mapping</h3>
<p>The following default data mapping is included in the fiscal document provider configuration that is provided as part of the fiscal integration sample.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tender type mapping:</strong> 1: 0; 2: 1; 3: 3; 4: 8; 5: 2; 6: 0; 7: 7; 8: 6; 9: 0; 10: 8; 11: 1</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>In each pair of values that is separated by a semicolon (;), the first number refers to a payment method that is set up for the store. The second number refers to a corresponding payment group in the EFR service, as represented by the <strong>PayG</strong> attribute.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Value-added tax (VAT) rates mapping:</strong> A: 19.00; B: 7.00; C: 10.70; D: 5.50; E: 0.00</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>In each pair of values that is separated by a semicolon (;), the letter refers to a tax group in the EFR service, as represented by the <strong>TaxG</strong> attribute. The number refers to the tax percentage.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Tax group for gift cards and deposits:</strong> G</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Tax group for VAT exempt:</strong> F</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="WARNING">
<h5>Warning</h5>
<p>Tax settings in the default data mapping are responsible for matching tax settings in the system and tax groups in the EFR service. Tax groups can be printed on receipts only if the <strong>Code for printing</strong> field is set on the <strong>Sales tax codes</strong> page.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="limitations-of-the-sample">Limitations of the sample</h3>
<p>The fiscal registration service supports only scenarios where sales tax is included in prices. Therefore, the <strong>Prices include sales tax</strong> option must be set to <strong>Yes</strong> for both stores and customers.</p>
<p>The fiscal service doesn't support situations where more than one sales tax code is applied to the same transaction line.</p>
<p>The fiscal integration framework doesn't support sales quotations. Therefore, those operations aren't registered in the fiscal service.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-commerce-for-germany">Set up Commerce for Germany</h2>
<p>This section describes the Commerce settings that are specific to and recommended for Germany. For more setup information, see <a href="../index.html">Commerce home page</a>.</p>
<p>To use the functionality that is specific to Germany, you must specify the following settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the primary address of the legal entity, set the <strong>Country/region</strong> field to <strong>DEU</strong> (Germany).</li>
<li>In the POS functionality profile of every store that is located in Austria, set the <strong>ISO code</strong> field to <strong>DE</strong> (Germany).</li>
</ul>
<p>You must also specify the following settings for Germany. Be sure to run appropriate distribution jobs after you complete the setup.</p>
<h3 id="set-up-vat-per-german-requirements">Set up VAT per German requirements</h3>
<p>You must create sales tax codes, sales tax groups, and item sales tax groups. You must also set up sales tax information for products and services. For more information about how to set up and use sales tax features, see <a href="../../financials/general-ledger/indirect-taxes-overview.md">Sales tax overview</a>.</p>
<p>On sales receipts, you can print an abbreviated code for a sales tax code (for example, &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot;). To make this functionality available, set the <strong>Code for printing</strong> field on the <strong>Sales tax codes</strong> page.</p>
<h3 id="set-up-stores">Set up stores</h3>
<p>On the <strong>All stores</strong> page, update the store details. Specifically, set the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>Sales tax group</strong> field, specify the sales tax group that should be used for sales to the default customer.</li>
<li>Set the <strong>Prices include sales tax</strong> option to <strong>Yes</strong>.</li>
<li>Set the <strong>Name</strong> field to the company name. This change helps ensure that the company name appears on a sales receipt. Alternatively, you can add the company name to the sales receipt layout as free-form text.</li>
<li>Set the <strong>Tax identification number (TIN)</strong> field to the company identification number. This change helps ensure that the company identification number appears on a sales receipt. Alternatively, you can add the company identification number to the sales receipt layout as free-form text.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="set-up-functionality-profiles">Set up functionality profiles</h3>
<p>Set up POS functionality profiles. On the <strong>Receipt numbering</strong> FastTab, set up receipt numbering by creating or updating records for the <strong>Sale</strong>, <strong>Sales order</strong>, and <strong>Return</strong> receipt transaction types.</p>
<h3 id="configure-custom-fields-so-that-they-can-be-used-in-receipt-formats-for-sales-receipts">Configure custom fields so that they can be used in receipt formats for sales receipts</h3>
<p>You can configure the language text and custom fields that are used in the POS receipt formats. The default company of the user who creates the receipt setup should be the same legal entity where the language text setup is created. Alternatively, the same language texts should be created in both the user's default company and the legal entity of the store that the setup is created for.</p>
<p>On the <strong>Language text</strong> page, add the following records for the labels of the custom fields for receipt layouts. Note that the <strong>Language ID</strong>, <strong>Text ID</strong>, and <strong>Text</strong> values that are shown in the table are just examples. You can change them to meet to your requirements. However, the <strong>Text ID</strong> values that you use must be unique, and they must be equal to or more than 900001.</p>
<p>Add the following POS labels to the <strong>POS</strong> section of the <strong>Language text</strong> page.</p>

<h2 id="design-of-extensions">Design of extensions</h2>
<h3 id="crt-extension-design">CRT extension design</h3>
<p>The purpose of the extension that is a fiscal document provider is to generate service-specific documents and handle responses from the fiscal registration service.</p>
<p>The CRT extension is <strong>Runtime.Extensions.DocumentProvider.EFRSample</strong>. For more details about the design of the fiscal integration solution, see <a href="fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.html#fiscal-registration-process-and-fiscal-integration-samples-for-fiscal-devices">Overview of fiscal integration for Commerce channels</a>.</p>
<h4 id="request-handler">Request handler</h4>
<p>There is one request handler for the document provider, <strong>DocumentProviderEFRFiscalDEU</strong>. This handler is used to generate fiscal documents for the fiscal registration service. It's inherited from the <strong>INamedRequestHandler</strong> interface. The <strong>HandlerName</strong> method is responsible for returning the name of the handler. The handler name should match the connector document provider name that is specified in Commerce Headquarters.</p>
<p>The connector supports the following requests:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GetFiscalDocumentDocumentProviderRequest</strong> – This request contains information about what document should be generated. It returns a service-specific document that should be registered in the fiscal registration service.</li>
<li><strong>GetFiscalTransactionExtendedDataDocumentProviderRequest</strong> – This request returns the response together with extended data.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="configuration">Configuration</h4>
<p>The <strong>DocumentProviderFiscalEFRSampleGermany</strong> configuration file is located in the <strong>Configuration</strong> folder of the extension project. The purpose of this file is to enable settings for the document provider to be configured from Commerce Headquarters. The file format is aligned with the requirements for fiscal integration configuration.</p>
<p>The following settings are added:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VAT rates mapping</strong> – The mapping of tax percentage values that are set up for the sales tax codes to values of the <strong>TaxG</strong> (tax group) attribute in requests that are sent to the fiscal service.</li>
<li><strong>Tax group for gift cards and deposits</strong> – The value of the <strong>TaxG</strong> attribute in requests that are sent to the fiscal service, based on operations that involve gift cards or deposits.</li>
<li><strong>Tender type mapping</strong> – The mapping of payment methods to values of the <strong>PayG</strong> (payment group) attribute in requests that are sent to the fiscal service.</li>
<li><strong>Tax group for VAT exempt</strong> – The value of the <strong>TaxG</strong> attribute in requests that are sent to the fiscal service, based on operations that are exempt from tax obligations.</li>
<li><strong>Include customer data</strong> – If this parameter is turned on, requests to the fiscal service will contain customer information such as names and addresses in cases where a customer is added to a transaction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hardware-station-extension-design">Hardware station extension design</h3>
<p>The purpose of the extension that is a fiscal connector is to communicate with the fiscal registration service.</p>
<p>The Hardware station extension is <strong>HardwareStation.Extension.EFRSample</strong>. It uses the HTTP protocol to submit documents that the CRT extension generates to the fiscal registration service. It also handles the responses that are received from the fiscal registration service.</p>
<h4 id="request-handler-1">Request handler</h4>
<p>The <strong>EFRHandler</strong> request handler is the entry point for handling requests to the fiscal registration service. This handler is inherited from the <strong>INamedRequestHandler</strong> interface. The <strong>HandlerName</strong> method is responsible for returning the name of the handler. The handler name should match the fiscal connector name that is specified in Commerce Headquarters.</p>
<p>The connector supports the following requests:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SubmitDocumentFiscalDeviceRequest</strong> – This request sends documents to the fiscal registration service and returns a response from it.</li>
<li><strong>IsReadyFiscalDeviceRequest</strong> – This request is used for a health check of the fiscal registration service.</li>
<li><strong>InitializeFiscalDeviceRequest</strong> – This request is used to initialize the fiscal registration service.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="configuration-1">Configuration</h4>
<p>The configuration file is located in the <strong>Configuration</strong> folder of the extension project. The purpose of the file is to enable settings for the fiscal connector to be configured from Commerce Headquarters. The file format is aligned with the requirements for fiscal integration configuration.</p>
<p>The following settings are added:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Endpoint address</strong> – The URL of the fiscal registration service.</li>
<li><strong>Timeout</strong> – The amount of time, in milliseconds (ms), that the driver will wait for a response from the fiscal registration service.</li>
<li><strong>Show fiscal registration notifications</strong> – If this parameter is turned on, notifications from the fiscal service will be shown as user messages at the POS.</li>
