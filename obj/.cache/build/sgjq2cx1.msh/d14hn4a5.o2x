<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/moving-average.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">Moving average is a perpetual costing method based on the average principle, where the costs on inventory issues do not change when the purchase cost does. The difference is capitalized and is based on a proportional calculation. The amount that remains is expensed.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/moving-average.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">When you use moving average, inventory settlements and inventory marking are not supported. Inventory close does not affect products that have moving average as the inventory model group, and it does not generate any settlements between the transactions.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/moving-average.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">The following are prerequisites when you use moving average cost as a costing method.</p>

<h2 id="convert-to-the-moving-average-costing-method" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/moving-average.md" sourcestartlinenumber="58">Convert to the moving average costing method</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/moving-average.md" sourcestartlinenumber="60">Products can be converted to use the moving average inventory valuation method. This type of conversion is usually done at the end of the year, after the last month of the current year is closed. It is done by using the product’s current costing model. You can change your inventory costing method from a costing method that is based on average cost or standard cost to a method that is based on moving average.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/moving-average.md" sourcestartlinenumber="62">If you are changing your costing method from a standard costing method to a moving average method, you have to complete the following tasks:</p>
<ol sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/moving-average.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/moving-average.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">Make adjustments to get inventory quantities and values down to 0 (zero).</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/moving-average.md" sourcestartlinenumber="65">After the inventory value and quantity are 0 (zero), change the item model group to moving average.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/moving-average.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">Make adjustments to get the quantity and value back into inventory.</li>
</ol>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/moving-average.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">You cannot change your inventory costing method from a moving average method to a First in, First out (FIFO) method, a Last in, First out (LIFO) method, or a weighted average method.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/moving-average.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">With moving average, the product’s cost is determined by the purchase receipt. When the purchase invoice is posted, if there is a difference in cost between the purchase receipt and the purchase invoice, the difference is proportionally adjusted to the current products in stock, and any remaining amount is expensed.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/moving-average.md" sourcestartlinenumber="84">In this example, a purchase order is created and received at one cost, and the purchase invoice is posted with a different cost.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/moving-average.md" sourcestartlinenumber="91">The difference in unit price, 2.00, is posted to the Price difference for moving average account when the purchase invoice is posted. The reason is that two products were purchased for a cost of 20.00. One of the products was sold for a unit price of 10.00. The purchase invoice was posted at a unit price of 12.00 with a quantity of 2. The unit price of the product cannot be posted at 14.00.</p>
