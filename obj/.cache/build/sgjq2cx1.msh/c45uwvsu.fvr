<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/production-order-cost-analysis.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">This article provides information about the cost analysis that you can do for completed and current production orders. You can analyze the estimated costs and actual costs by using the Price calculation page or the Cost estimates and costings report. You can view information about the estimated and actual costs (and quantity) for each component item, the routing operation, and the indirect cost.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/production-order-cost-analysis.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">The actual costs for a production order are based on the reported consumption of material and routing operations. You can access detailed transactions about the reported consumption of material, routing operations, and indirect costs for a production order on the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/production-order-cost-analysis.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">Production posting</strong> page.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/cost-management/production-order-cost-analysis.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">The variances reflect a comparison of the reported production activities and the calculation of standard costs for the production item. The variances don't reflect a comparison to the production order's estimated costs. The production activities that are reported include the consumption of material and routing operations, together with the associated indirect costs, and the quantity that is reported as finished. The following four types of variance are calculated:</p>
