<p sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">In many cases, preparing an offer package for a candidate needs to be a very quick process.
Using the templates set up by the Attract administrator will cut down the time and
effort for the offer creators to prepare and send offers to a candidate.</p>
<h2 id="create-an-offer" sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">Create an offer</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">When the Offer management app is turned on, any user with the role of hiring manager or recruiter can prepare an offer package for the candidate. To prepare the offer, do the following.</p>
<ol sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">
<li sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44"><p sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">Navigate to the job and the candidate application that you are creating the offer for.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="48">You will be redirected to the Offer app where you can see the candidate with the status of <strong sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="48">New</strong>. You can also see other offers that you are contributing to, either as a creator or an approver.</p>
</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="50"><p sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="50">Click <strong sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="50">Prepare Offer</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="approve-an-offer" sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="73">Approve an offer</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="75">Most offers need to go through an approval process to make sure the offer meets the necessary standards. If an offer does not meet standards, for example if the offer creator didn't follow the offer data rules and overrode the values in the offer, the approval process will be mandated. To send an offer for approval, do the following.</p>
<ol sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="77">
<li sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="77"><p sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="77">When the offer is in a draft state, add approvers on the <strong sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="77">Approver panel</strong>.</p>

<div class="NOTE" sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="86">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="87">If the offer was non-standard, you are required to provide a justification.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="91">Approvers will receive an email asking them to approve the offer. They can click the link in the email to open the offer, review the
entire offer package, and either approve it or send it back to the offer creator. Offer approvers will need to add an additional note if they are rejecting the offer package for further edits.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="94">In cases where there is a new version of the offer created before the approver acts, the approver won’t be able to approve or reject the offer.</p>
<h2 id="offer-versioning" sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="96">Offer versioning</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="98">When the offer has been approved or sent back for further edits, you can choose the <strong sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="98">Enable editing</strong> option to create a new version of the offer. The new version of the offer version has all the offer data values and the list of approvers carried over from the last version.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/creating-offers.md" sourcestartlinenumber="100">Approvers can switch between different offer versions if the versions were shared with them for approval. Also, an approver or offer creator can choose to delete a specific draft offer version to go back to the previous state.</p>
