<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/foreign-currency-revaluation-general-ledger.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">This topic provides an overview of the following for the general ledger foreign currency revaluation process -  setup, running the process, calculation for the process, and how to reverse the revaluation transactions, if necessary.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/foreign-currency-revaluation-general-ledger.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">As part of a period-end, accounting conventions require general ledger account balances in foreign currencies to be revalued using different exchange rate types (current, historical, average, etc.). For example, one accounting convention requires assets and liabilities to be revalued at the current exchange rate, fixed assets at the historical exchange rate, and profit and loss accounts at the monthly average. The General ledger foreign currency revaluation can be used to revalue the balance sheet and profit and loss accounts.</p>
<div class="NOTE" sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/foreign-currency-revaluation-general-ledger.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/foreign-currency-revaluation-general-ledger.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">Foreign currency revaluation is also available in Accounts receivable (AR) and Accounts payable (AP). If you are using those modules, the outstanding transactions should be revalued using the foreign currency revaluation in those modules. The AR and AP foreign currency revaluation will create an accounting entry in General ledger to reflect the unrealized gain or loss, ensuring that the subledgers and general ledger can be reconciled. Because the AR and AP foreign currency revaluation create accounting entries in General ledger, the accounts receivable and accounts payable main accounts should be excluded from the General ledger foreign currency revaluation.</p>
</div>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/foreign-currency-revaluation-general-ledger.md" sourcestartlinenumber="43">When you run the revaluation process, the balance in each main account posted in a foreign currency will be revalued. The unrealized gain or loss transactions that are created during the revaluation process are system-generated. Two transactions might be created, one for the accounting currency and a second for the reporting currency, if relevant. Each accounting entry will post to the unrealized gain or loss and the main account being revalued.</p>

When you revalue profit and loss accounts, the sum of all transactions that occur within the date interval are revalued. When you revalue balance sheet accounts, the From date is ignored. Instead, the balance to be revalued is determined by going from the beginning of the fiscal year until the To date.</p>

The preview in General ledger is different from the simulation in the AR and AP foreign currency revaluation. The simulation in AR and AP is a report, but general ledger has a preview which can be posted, without having to run the revaluation process again. The results of the preview can be exported to Microsoft Excel to retain the history of how the amounts were calculated. You cannot use batch processing if you want to preview the results of the revaluation. From the preview, the user has the option to post the results of all legal entities using the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/foreign-currency-revaluation-general-ledger.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">Post</strong> button.

<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/foreign-currency-revaluation-general-ledger.md" sourcestartlinenumber="79">The unrealized gain/loss transactions are created differently between General ledger revaluation and the AR and AP revaluation process. In AR and AP, the previous revaluation is completely reversed (assuming the transaction isn’t settled yet) and a new revaluation transaction is created for the unrealized gain/loss based on the new exchange rate. This is because we revalue each individual transaction in AR and AP. In General ledger, the previous revaluation is not reversed. Instead, a transaction is created for the delta between the balance of the main account, including any previous revaluation amounts, and the new value based on the exchange rate for the Date of Rate.</p>

<h2 id="reverse-foreign-currency-revaluation" sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/foreign-currency-revaluation-general-ledger.md" sourcestartlinenumber="113">Reverse foreign currency revaluation</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/foreign-currency-revaluation-general-ledger.md" sourcestartlinenumber="114">If you need to reverse the revaluation transaction, select the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/foreign-currency-revaluation-general-ledger.md" sourcestartlinenumber="114">Reverse transaction</strong> button on the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/foreign-currency-revaluation-general-ledger.md" sourcestartlinenumber="114">Foreign currency revaluation</strong> page. A new foreign currency revaluation historical record will be created to maintain the historical audit trail of when the revaluation occurred or was reversed.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/foreign-currency-revaluation-general-ledger.md" sourcestartlinenumber="116">You can reverse the results of the revaluation out of date order, but you may need to also reverse a more current revaluation to ensure the correct balances for each revalued main account. The reversals can occur out of date order because there is no way to control which main accounts are revalued and the frequency of when they are revalued. For example, an organization may choose to revalue their cash main accounts on a quarterly basis, but all other main accounts monthly.</p>
