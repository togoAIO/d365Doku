<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="35">In general, Microsoft devotes significant resources to generating the business process functionality of our applications by developing features and functionality that address specific tax accounting or financial regulatory requirements in countries or regions where Dynamics 365 Finance is generally available.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="37">The software, which helps business operations comply with country/region-specific laws, regulations, and common business practices for handling routine activities, is designed to include features and functionality that address the specific central and state government tax, accounting, and financial or statutory reporting laws or regulations that usually govern business in India. However, because laws and regulations are diverse and numerous, not all laws, regulations, or commercial requirements in India are covered. For example, regulatory features that Microsoft develops and makes generally available in India don't usually support industry-specific laws or national standards, laws that are specific to particular states, or city or municipal legal requirements, except as noted in this topic.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">Channel partners are a very important part of the global strategy for delivering Dynamics 365 Finance. Their deliberation helps crystallize the thought process and helps Microsoft design a roadmap for achieving excellence in localization requirements. The flexible, need-based architecture of Finance is useful to channel partners as they try to address a customer's specific business needs during development, configuration, and implementation. Although channel partners might provide solutions that meet specific regulatory requirements that are unique to cities, states, or other regions in India, Microsoft doesn't provide any guarantees or warranties (expressed, implied, statutory, or otherwise) that partner-created solutions comply with local business, tax, and regulatory, legal, or other applicable requirements. Channel partners and customers are solely responsible for any configurations, customizations, localizations, or translations (and any updates to these configurations, customizations, localizations, or translations) that they create or implement on behalf of customers. They are also solely responsible for any support or other service that is provided to customers for such solutions. Users must contact their channel partner for information about the solutions that the channel partner creates for licensed versions of Finance.</p>

<h2 id="indian-localization-strategy" sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="53">Indian localization strategy</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="55">To address the tax (direct and indirect), financial accounting, and statutory reporting requirements for India, the strategy that Microsoft adopted involves providing localizations. This strategy consists of the following elements:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="57">
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="57">Meet the central-level tax requirements that are described in the <a href="#indian-localization-scope" sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="57">Indian localization scope</a> section of this topic.</li>

<h5>Note</h5>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">There is no focus on the requirements of specific businesses, segments, verticals, or regions, even when this focus is required by laws, statutes, or regulations at the federal, state, or city level. Only those city-specific tax requirements that are described in the <a href="#indian-localization-scope" sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">Indian localization scope</a> section are included.</p>
</div>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">Some laws and requirements are out of scope for this app. The localization that Microsoft develops for Finance is limited to the features and functionality that are described in this topic. Therefore, the localization must be analyzed by prospective customers or a tax professional, such as an accounting and tax auditor, a tax law firm, or a tributary consulting firm that can assess whether the functionality will meet the customer's business needs, or whether custom solutions are required.</p>
<h2 id="indian-localization-scope" sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">Indian localization scope</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">The localization of this app provides a configuration for language, user interface, and Help settings. The Indian localization is available in English-IN. Additional documentation, such as white papers and comprehensive training materials, is also available in English.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="72">The localization scope for Finance in India is limited to fiscal and financial accounting transactions in the following areas:</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="85">The features that Microsoft delivers and supports as part of the Indian localization are listed later in this topic.</p>
<h2 id="market-availability" sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="87">Market availability</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="89">Microsoft tries to deliver regulatory updates and changes so that there is enough time to install and implement them. For tax and regulatory updates that must be incorporated into Finance, the goal is to release the updates before the effective date or other date that is mandated by the tax authorities, regardless of whether the tax is central or state government tax. In that way, channel partners can acquaint themselves with features and have enough time to update their customer solutions. Internally, Microsoft calls this delivery date the &quot;market required date&quot; (MRD).</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="91">Microsoft tries to meet its established MRDs and dates that are mandated by the various government authorities. However, various factors can adversely affect the timely delivery of tax and regulatory updates. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="93">
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="93">Legislative or regulatory changes that the government makes at short notice before the date of law enforcement</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="94">Feature, functionality, infrastructure, or architectural limitations of the affected software versions that are generally available in the marketplace</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="95">The complexity and coverage of any coding, redesign, or improvement of the software that is required to implement the legislation or regulatory requirements</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="96">Schedule conflicts</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="98">In any situation where Microsoft finds it difficult to meet these dates, it makes reasonable efforts to develop and release tax and regulatory updates as soon as possible.</p>
<h4 id="disclaimer" sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="100">Disclaimer</h4>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="102">Any dates that Microsoft publishes are for planning only and are subject to change at any time, without notice.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/apac-ind-scope.md" sourcestartlinenumber="104">Microsoft makes no representations, warranties, or guarantees about the timeliness or completeness of any tax or regulatory updates that it provides and, to the maximum extent that is permitted under applicable law, disclaims all implied warranties and conditions, such as implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.</p>
