<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/revenue-recognition-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="61">A new journal type has been introduced for revenue recognition. The journal is required and is used in two scenarios.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/revenue-recognition-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="63">The first scenario occurs after all the contractual obligations are met, when the deferred revenue is recognized by creating a revenue recognition journal that is based on the details of the revenue schedule. The journal contains an accounting entry that moves the balance from the deferred revenue ledger account to the revenue ledger account.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/revenue-recognition-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="65">The second scenario occurs when a journal is created after reallocation occurs. Reallocation occurs when a sales order line is added to a previously invoiced sales order, or when a new sales order is created that includes a line that is part of the original contract. If an invoice was posted before the new sales order line is added, a correcting accounting entry must be created for the posted customer invoice.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/revenue-recognition-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="67">The journal is set up on the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/revenue-recognition-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="67">Journal names</strong> page (<strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/revenue-recognition-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="67">Revenue recognition &gt; Setup &gt; Journal names</strong>).

<h2 id="revenue-schedules" sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/revenue-recognition-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="84">Revenue schedules</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/revenue-recognition-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="86">A revenue schedule must be created for each occurrence that revenue can be deferred for. For example, if your organization offers support over six-month, 12-month, 18-month, and 24-month periods, you must create a revenue schedule for each period. The setup of the revenue schedule determines how the revenue price is allocated across the number of periods that you select. It also determines the default dates that are entered for the revenue schedule that is created when the invoice is posted.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/revenue-recognition-setup.md" sourcestartlinenumber="88">If you recognize revenue by milestone, we recommend that you create a revenue recognition schedule for the number of milestones, regardless of the recognition dates. After you create the schedules, you can edit them so that they reflect the expected milestone dates. These records can be put on hold until you're notified that the milestone has been met and revenue can be recognized.</p>
