<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="37">This topic provides an overview of the process of bank foreign currency revaluation. It explains how to set up and run the process, and provides information about the calculation for the process. It also explains how to reverse revaluation transactions, if reversal is required.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">As part of a period end, accounting conventions require that bank account balances in foreign currencies be revalued by using different exchange rate types (current, historical, average, and so on). The bank foreign currency revaluation feature can be used to revalue one or more bank accounts. The feature is also a global feature. Therefore, from a single page, you can revalue banks across all the legal entities that you have access to.</p>
<div class="NOTE" sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">When you run the revaluation process, the balance in each bank account that is posted in a foreign currency will be revalued. The unrealized gain or loss transactions that are created during the revaluation process are system-generated. Two transactions might be created, one for the accounting currency and one for the reporting currency, if a reporting currency is relevant. Each accounting entry will be posted to the unrealized gain or loss and the main account that is being revalued.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="46">Before you run the revaluation process, the following setup is required.</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="48">

You can run the process in real time, or you can schedule it to run by using a batch.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">The <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Foreign currency revaluation</strong> page shows the history of each revaluation process. It shows when the process was run and what criteria were defined, and provides a link to the voucher that was created for the revaluation. It also shows whether a previous revaluation was reversed. To run the revaluation process, select <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Foreign currency revaluation</strong> on the Action Pane to open the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Bank - foreign currency revaluation</strong> dialog box.</p>

The sum of all bank transactions that occurred up through this date is revalued.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">The <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">Exchange rate date</strong> field defines the date of the exchange rate that will be used to revalue the currency balances. For example, you can revalue the balances as of January 31 but use the exchange rate that is defined for February 1.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">The revaluation process can be run for one or more legal entities. The lookup shows only the legal entities that you have access to. Select the legal entities for which you want to select the bank accounts that are eligible for foreign currency revaluation.

<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="84">In Cash and bank management, the bank currency is considered to be the base currency and it is not revalued. The balance of the bank account in the accounting currency is revalued using the exchange rates between the bank currency and the accounting currency on the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="84">Exchange rate date</strong>. The balance of the bank account in the reporting currency is also revalued using the exchange rates between the bank currency and the reporting currency on the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="84">Exchange rate date</strong>.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="86">A transaction is created for the difference between the balance of the bank account and the new balance that is calculated for the accounting currency. Another transaction is created for the difference between the balance of the bank account and the new balance that is calculated for the reporting currency. The entries for these transactions are marked as reconciled.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="88">No entry is made for the accounting currency if the bank currency matches the accounting currency. Likewise, no entry is made for the reporting currency if the bank currency matches the reporting currency.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="90">The foreign currency revaluation transaction is also split across the dimensions that are found on the bank transactions. The split is based on the balance for each dimension. For example, the total bank balance is 10,000, but the balance for business unit 001 is 4,000, whereas the balance for business unit 002 is 6,000. In this case, 40 percent of the revaluation amount is posted to the revaluation account that has business unit 001, and 60 percent is posted to the revaluation account that has business unit 002. If the account structure doesn't include a business unit, the full amount is posted to the revaluation account.</p>
<h2 id="reverse-foreign-currency-revaluation" sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="92">Reverse foreign currency revaluation</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="94">If you must reverse the revaluation transaction, select <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="94">Reverse transaction</strong> on the Action Pane of the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="94">Foreign currency revaluation</strong> page. A new foreign currency revaluation historical record is created to maintain the historical audit trail of when the revaluation occurred or was reversed.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/bank-revaluation.md" sourcestartlinenumber="96">To reverse several revaluations, you must reverse the most current revaluation first. Then continue to reverse older revaluations in date order. You can then process new revaluations for the periods that you reversed.</p>
