<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>Exchange rates and amount difference settings are designed to correctly reflect exchange rate and amount differences in accounting and tax accounting. However, the amount difference has been canceled in accounting and tax accounting since 01.01.2007 - in accounting and since 01.01.2015 - in tax accounting. Nevertheless, the amount difference functionality still exists in Dynamics 365 Finance. This topic describes that functionality.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Amount differences are canceled  in tax accounting from 1.1.2015 in Russia.</p>
</div>
<p>An original facture can be corrected if the currency values change during the shipment of goods. After the facture is corrected, the company verifies that the total of the correction is equal to the total of the amount difference. An amount difference facture is generated when a purchase or sales transaction is settled under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The invoice currency and the company currency differ.</li>
<li>The payment currency is equal to the company currency.</li>
<li>The exchange rate of the invoice currency on the invoice date differs from the exchange rate on the payment date.</li>
<li>The amount difference affects the company's liability for value-added tax (VAT).</li>
</ul>
<p>Any amount difference facture that is generated is processed independently of other factures, and is included in the sales book and purchase book. You can then print the amount difference facture and the original facture that was adjusted based on the amount difference.</p>
<p>Use this procedure to set up parameters for amount differences for exchange rates. When you post an exchange adjustment transaction, it's posted to the ledger account that is defined on the <strong>Currency revaluation accounts</strong> page. All adjustments are posted to ledger accounts. You must set the posting rules, and you must set the taxable parameter for a positive or negative amount difference.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Select <strong>General ledger</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Currency</strong> &gt; <strong>Currency parameters</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="set-up-accounts-payable-parameters-for-amount-differences">Set up accounts payable parameters for amount differences</h2>
<p>You use the <strong>Accounts payable parameters</strong> page to set up accounts payable parameters for amount differences. Facture amount differences are included in a separate list that is created in the purchase book for the specified period. This list contains the cancellation of the source facture and the new facture that is recalculated at payment.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>If more than one payment is made during a tax period, the recalculated facture amount is the total of the recalculated payments. If all the payments belong to the same tax period that the invoice belongs to, the total facture is reflected in the purchase book.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Accounts payable</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts payable parameters</strong>.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Ledger and sales tax</strong> tab, on the <strong>Purchase book</strong> FastTab, set the <strong>Amount difference in additional list</strong> option to <strong>Yes</strong> to include the amount differences in an additional list in the purchase book.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="amount-difference-factures-for-sales-and-purchase-orders">Amount difference factures for sales and purchase orders</h2>
<p>Before you can generate an amount difference facture, you must create and post a facture for a purchase order or sales order. After you post the facture, you settle the facture transactions to generate the amount differences, based on the exchange rates.</p>
<p>Amount difference factures are corrections for factures. Based on the amount differences, the original factures are shown in the sales book (for sales original invoices) and purchase book (for purchase original invoices). In the sales book, they appear as separate lines. However, they have the same facture identifier and the same date as the original facture. In the purchase book, they appear as a total line, where the sum of the amount differences is added to the original facture amount.</p>
<p>You can recalculate the cost of the original facture so that the amount difference is considered. In the additional list, the original facture amount has a negative sign, and the recalculated facture amount has a positive sign. You can print the amount differences from the <strong>Facture journal</strong> page in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include all amount difference factures.</li>
<li>Include only selected amount difference factures.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>The following example shows how amount differences are calculated for a contract.</p>
<p>The cost of the received goods is 100 standard units, and the tax accounting period is monthly. Payments are made in Russian rubles (RUB) by using the currency rate on the payment date.</p>
<p>If the currency rate is 32 RUB for one standard unit, two invoice lines are created, as shown in the following table.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Standard units</th>
<th>Invoice amount</th>
<th>VAT percent</th>
<th>Standard units (including VAT percentage)</th>
<th>Invoice amount (including VAT percentage)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>40</td>
<td>1,280</td>
<td>18</td>
<td>6.10</td>
<td>195.20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>60</td>
<td>1,920</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>5.45</td>
<td>174.20</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If the currency rate changes from 32 RUB to 28 RUB, the payment for the received goods also changes. For 20 standard units, the payment becomes 560 RUB. Therefore, during transaction settlement, an amount difference (28 – 32) is generated and appears on the facture lines. You can also calculate the total cost and total tax for every tax code.</p>
<p>If <em>A</em> is the corrected number of standard units, based on the amount difference for the first facture line, here is the proportion for the VAT calculation:</p>
<p>20:100 = A:40</p>
<p>Therefore, A = 20 × 40 ÷ 100 = 8.</p>
<p>Therefore, the correction for the first line is 8 × (28 – 32) = –32 RUB.</p>
<p>If <em>B</em> is the corrected number of standard units, based on the amount difference for the second facture line, here is the proportion for the VAT calculation:</p>
<p>20:100 = B:60</p>
<p>Therefore, B = 20 × 60 ÷ 100 = 12.</p>
<p>Therefore, the correction for the second line is 12 × (28 – 32) = –48 RUB.</p>
<p>VAT is applied to the amount difference. For VAT at 18 percent, the value is (32 ÷ 118) × 18 = 4.88 RUB. For VAT at 10 percent, the value is (48 ÷ 110) × 10 = 4.36 RUB.</p>
