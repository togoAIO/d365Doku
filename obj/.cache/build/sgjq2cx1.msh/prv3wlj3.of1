<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="34">You can use the cash flow forecasting tools to analyze upcoming cash flow and currency requirements, so that you can estimate the company's future need for cash. To obtain a forecast of the cash flow, you must complete the following tasks:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">Identify and list all the liquidity accounts. Liquidity accounts are the company's accounts for cash or cash equivalents.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="37">Configure the behavior for forecasts of transactions that affect the company's liquidity accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">After you've completed these tasks, you can calculate and analyze forecasts of the cash flow and upcoming currency requirements.</p>
<h2 id="cash-flow-forecasting-integration" sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">Cash flow forecasting integration</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="43">Cash flow forecasting can be integrated with General ledger, Accounts payable, Accounts receivable, Budgeting and inventory management. The forecasting process uses transaction information that is entered in the system, and the calculation process forecasts the expected cash impact of each transaction. The following types of transactions are considered when the cash flow is calculated:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="45">

</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="54">Although there is no direct integration with Project management and accounting, there are several ways to include project transactions in the cash flow forecast. Posted project invoices are included in the forecast as part of open customer transactions. Project-initiated sales orders and purchase orders are included in the forecast as open orders after they are entered in the system. You can also transfer project forecasts to a ledger budget model. This ledger budget model is then included in the cash flow forecast as part of the budget register entries.</p>
<h2 id="configuration" sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="56">Configuration</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="58">To configure the cash flow forecasting process, use the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="58">Cash flow forecast setup</strong> page. On this page, you specify the liquidity accounts to track and the default forecasting behaviors for each area.</p>
<h3 id="general-ledger" sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="60">General ledger</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="62">You must first define the liquidity accounts to track through cash flow forecasting. Typically, these liquidity accounts are main accounts that are associated with the bank accounts that will receive and disburse cash. On the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="62">Cash flow forecast setup</strong> page, on the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="62">General ledger</strong> tab, select the main accounts to include for forecasting. If a bank account has been associated with the main account on the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="62">Bank account</strong> page, it's shown in the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="62">Bank account</strong> field.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">You can set up a dependent cash flow forecast for a main account that contains transactions that are directly related to transactions in another main account. Each line that you add in the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">In the Dependent accounts</strong> section creates a cash flow forecast amount in a dependent main account. This amount is a percentage of the cash flow amounts to the primary main account that you selected.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">First, set the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">Main account</strong> field to the primary main account where transactions are expected to initially occur. Set the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">Dependent main account</strong> field to the account that will be affected by the initial transaction against the primary main account. Set appropriate values for the other fields on the line. You can change the value in the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">Percent</strong> field to reflect the effect of the primary main account on the dependent main account. For a sales or purchase forecast, select a <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">Terms of payment</strong> value that is typical for most customers or vendors. Set the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">Posting type</strong> field to the expected posting type that is related to the cash flow forecast.</p>
