<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/emea-advance-invoice.md" sourcestartlinenumber="34">An advance invoice is a document that you can create for a customer or vendor. It states the amount that must be prepaid on a sales order. This topic provides information about advance invoices for Eastern Europe.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/emea-advance-invoice.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">Advance invoice functionality lets you perform the following tasks:</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/emea-advance-invoice.md" sourcestartlinenumber="46">Polish companies that receive prepayments must create an invoice for prepayments for the customer. This advance invoice is posted to the general ledger and is a mandatory document for VAT tax purposes. The tax that is calculated on the advance invoice must be reported to the tax authority. When the final sale of goods is performed, the advance invoice should be specified on the sales invoice. The total amount of sales must include prepayments. When the sales invoice is posted, the settled advance invoice will be reversed. The original advance invoice will be settled with an advance invoice reversal.</p>
