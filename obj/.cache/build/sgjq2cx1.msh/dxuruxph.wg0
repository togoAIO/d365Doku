<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/rus-fixed-assets-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="32">The <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/rus-fixed-assets-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="32">Fixed assets (Russia)</strong> module provides automated accounting of fixed assets, intangible assets, and also working clothes, special rigging, and fixed assets that aren't considered valuable, from the time when they are put into operation and posted to the appropriate accounts until they are disposed of.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/rus-fixed-assets-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="34">The requirements for fixed asset accounting in Russian Federation legislation vary, depending on whether an account is used for accounting purposes or tax purposes. Therefore, to meet the requirements of Russian Federation law, at least two accounting models, financial and tax accounting, should be used for fixed asset accounting records. As a rule, there can be an unlimited number of value models. In addition, you can add models for internal business accounts and for accounts that are based on international standards of accounting.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/rus-fixed-assets-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">All transactions for fixed assets and intangible assets can be calculated simultaneously, based on unlimited value models for a single company. For each value model, you can define the currency, posting profile, and financial dimension codes.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/rus-fixed-assets-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">A depreciating asset is divided into depreciation groups in a value model. Therefore, the setup of depreciation accrual for various fixed asset subgroups in the value models is flexible. Depreciation groups are used to organize accounting and tax accounting.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/rus-fixed-assets-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">Fixed asset transactions can be allocated to various dimension codes, in the same way that they are allocated throughout your accounting system. Cost centers, departments, and expense codes for profit tax can be used as dimension codes.</p>

A depreciation bonus is an additional depreciation amount that is assessed during the first year for some asset types that are operational. You can calculate a depreciation bonus by reducing the value of an asset through means other than the usual rate of depreciation. You can apply depreciation bonus amounts during the accounting period, after the asset is put into operation, or after major repairs. Depreciation bonuses are always calculated and applied before other types of depreciation.</li>

These assets are known as not valuable fixed assets (NVFAs). NVFAs are items that cost less than the specified cost limit. The full cost of NVFAs should be written off for depreciation in the first month of use. During the process of purchasing fixed assets, the system divides fixed assets and NVFAs by price, based on the value of the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/rus-fixed-assets-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="118">Max cost of the NVFA</strong> parameter.</p>

You can create queries to show all the assets that are on hand for employees, and you can print the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/rus-fixed-assets-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="122">Working clothes issue sheet (No. MB-7)</strong>. You can cancel the working clothes or special rigging issue, or return it to inventory, and you can calculate the net book value and residual wearing period.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/rus-fixed-assets-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="124">Working clothes and special rigging assets are regulated by their useful life cycle. This period starts when the item is written off from a warehouse and issued to an employee. It ends after the stipulated period of use. The useful life of each item is specified in months. All the data that is related to an item is linked. This information includes the identity of the employee, the useful life of the item, the date when the item is issued to the employee, and the end date that is calculated based on the rating of the item. When the end of the useful life approaches, the item is written off, so that it's no longer assigned to the employee.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/rus-fixed-assets-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="126">During their life cycle, the cost of these types of assets must be amortized. If the life cycle is longer than the legally defined rate of twelve months, the linear method of depreciation is used. If it's less than twelve months, the cost is written off when the item is issued to the employee.
