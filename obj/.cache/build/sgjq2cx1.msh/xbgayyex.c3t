<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/production-control/config-job-card-device.md" sourcestartlinenumber="33">The job card device is used by the shop floor workers to register their daily work, such as when jobs are started, reporting feedback on jobs, registering indirect activities, and reporting absence. These registrations are the basis for tracking progress and cost on production orders and for calculating the basis for the workers' pay. This topic describes the various options for configuring job card devices.</p>
