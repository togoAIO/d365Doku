<h1 id="fifo-with-physical-value-and-marking">FIFO with physical value and marking</h1>


<p>First in, First out (FIFO) is an inventory model in which the first acquired receipts are issued first. Financially updated issues from inventory are settled against the first financially updated receipts into inventory, based on the financial date of the inventory transaction.</p>
<p>When you use FIFO, you don’t have to use the FIFO rule. Instead, you can mark inventory transactions so that a specific item receipt is settled against a specific issue. We recommend a periodic inventory closing when you use the FIFO inventory model. The following examples show the effect of using FIFO in three configurations:</p>
<ul>
<li>FIFO without the <strong>Include physical value</strong> option</li>
<li>FIFO with the <strong>Include physical value</strong> option</li>
<li>FIFO with marking</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fifo-without-the-include-physical-value-option">FIFO without the Include physical value option</h2>
<p>In this example, the item model group isn't marked to include physical value. The illustration that follows shows these transactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>1a. Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 10.00 each.</li>
<li>1b. Inventory financial receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 10.00 each.</li>
<li>2a. Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 2 at a cost of USD 10.00 each.</li>
<li>2b. Inventory financial receipt for a quantity of 2 at a cost of USD 10.00 each.</li>
<li>3a. Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 25.00 each.</li>
<li>4a. Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 30.00 each.</li>
<li>4b. Inventory financial receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 30.00 each.</li>
<li>5a. Inventory physical issue for a quantity of 1 at a cost price of USD 20.00 each (running average of financially updated transactions).</li>
<li>5b. Inventory financial issue for a quantity of 1 at a cost price of USD 15.00 each (running average of financially updated transactions).</li>
<li>
<ol start="6">
<li>Inventory close is performed. Based on the FIFO method, the first financially updated issue will be settled against the first financially updated receipt. An adjustment of USD –5.00 will be made on the issue transaction.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The new running average cost price reflects the average of the financially updated transactions. The following illustrations shows the effects of the FIFO inventory model on this series of transactions when the <strong>Include physical value</strong> option isn't used.</p>

<h2 id="fifo-with-the-include-physical-value-option">FIFO with the Include physical value option</h2>
<p>If the <strong>Include physical value</strong> check box is selected for an item on the <strong>Item model group</strong> page, the system uses both physical and financial receipt transactions to calculate the running average cost price. Where applicable, the system also makes adjustments to the physically updated issue transaction. When the <strong>Include physical value</strong> check box is cleared, inventory close with the FIFO inventory model makes settlements only to transactions that are financially updated. The illustration that follows shows these transactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>1a. Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 10.00 each.</li>
<li>1b. Inventory financial receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 10.00 each.</li>
<li>2a. Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 20.00 each.</li>
<li>2b. Inventory financial receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 20.00 each.</li>
<li>3a. Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 25.00 each.</li>
<li>4a. Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 30.00 each.</li>
<li>4b. Inventory financial receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 30.00 each.</li>
<li>5a. Inventory physical issue for a quantity of 1 at a cost price of USD 21.25 each (running average of financial and physical updated transactions).</li>
<li>5b. Inventory financial issue for a quantity of 1 at a cost price of USD 21.25 each (running average of financial and physical updated transactions).</li>
<li>6a. Inventory physical issue for a quantity of 1 at a cost price of USD 21.25 each.</li>
<li>
<ol start="7">
<li>Inventory close is performed. Based on the FIFO method, the first financial issue transaction will be adjusted or settled against the first updated receipt, either financial or physical.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Transaction 5b will be settled against receipt transaction 1b. There will be an adjustment of USD –11.25 to this issue transaction. The new running average cost price reflects the average of the financially and physically updated transactions, USD 27.50. The following illustration shows the effects of the FIFO inventory model on this series of transactions when the <strong>Include physical value</strong> option is used.</p>

<h2 id="fifo-with-marking">FIFO with marking</h2>
<p>Marking is a process that lets you link, or mark, an issue transaction to a receipt transaction. Marking can occur either before or after a transaction is posted. You can use marking when you want to be sure of the exact cost of inventory when the transaction is posted or the inventory close is performed. For example, the Customer Service department accepted a rush order from an important customer. Because this order is a rush order, you must pay more for this item in order to fulfill your customer’s request. You must make sure that the cost of this inventory item is reflected in the margin, or cost of goods sold (COGS), for this sales order invoice. When the purchase order is posted, the inventory is received at a cost of USD 120.00. If this sales order document is marked to the purchase order before the packing slip or invoice is posted, the COGS will be USD 120.00, not the current running average cost for the item. If the sales order packing slip or invoice is posted before the marking occurs, the COGS will be posted at the running average cost price. Before inventory close is performed, these two transactions can still be marked to each other. When a receipt transaction matches an issue transaction, the valuation method that is defined in the item model group is disregarded, and the system settles these transactions to each other. You can mark an issue transaction to a receipt before the transaction is posted. You can do this from a sales order line on the <strong>Sales order details</strong> page. You can view the open receipt transactions on the <strong>Marking</strong> page. You can also mark an issue transaction to a receipt after the transaction is posted. You can match or mark an issue transaction for an open receipt transaction for an inventoried item from a posted inventory adjustment journal. The illustration that follows shows these transactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>1a. Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 10.00 each.</li>
<li>1b. Inventory financial receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 10.00 each.</li>
<li>2a. Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 20.00 each.</li>
<li>2b. Inventory financial receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 20.00 each.</li>
<li>3a. Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 25.00 each.</li>
<li>4a. Inventory physical receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 30.00 each.</li>
<li>4b. Inventory financial receipt for a quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 30.00 each.</li>
<li>5a. Inventory physical issue for a quantity of 1 at a cost price of USD 21.25 each (running average of financial and physical updated transactions).</li>
<li>5b. Inventory financial issue for a quantity of 1 is marked to inventory receipt 2b before the transaction is posted. This transaction is posted at a cost price of USD 20.00 each.</li>
<li>6a. Inventory physical issue for a quantity of 1 at a cost price of USD 21.25 each.</li>
<li>
<ol start="7">
<li>Inventory close is performed. Because the financially updated FIFO transaction is marked to an existing receipt, these transactions are settled against each other, and no adjustment is made.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The new running average cost price reflects the average of the financially and physically updated transactions, USD 27.50. The following illustration shows the effects of the FIFO inventory model on this series of transactions when marking between issues and receipts is used.</p>
