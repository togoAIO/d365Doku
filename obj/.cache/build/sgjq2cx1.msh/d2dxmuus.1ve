<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="34">Many retailers would like to optimize order fulfillment by enabling stores to fill orders. Order fulfillment at the store level can help to ease overstock scenarios for a specific store, or may be needed from a logistical standpoint in cases where a store has extra capacity or is located within closer shipping distance to the customer. To address this need, a unified order fulfillment operation is available at the point of sale.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">Orders for fulfillment at a specific store have the store's warehouse designated on the header or lines of the order.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">The order fulfillment operation in the point of sale provides a single work area in the point of sale that can be used to process orders. This includes everything from accepting the order, to marking it as shipped, or initiating store pickup.</p>
<h2 id="access-unified-order-fulfillment-in-the-point-of-sale" sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">Access unified order fulfillment in the point of sale</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">Order fulfillment, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/retail/pos-operations" sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">Operation ID 928</a>, can be used to access the store order fulfillment work area in the point of sale.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">The order fulfillment operation does not have its own permission out-of-the-box, but in the future, users will be able to use the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">Allow retrieve order</strong> permission to invoke the operation from the point of sale.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="46">At the store level, a configuration setting is available to determine whether an order line must be accepted manually from within the point of sale. If that configuration option is not set, order lines will be accepted by default. If that configuration option is turned on, users at the point of sale will need to select <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="46">Allow accept order</strong> permission to accept orders from within the point of sale.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="48">Order lines can also be rejected from the point of sale. Rejecting an order line signifies that it will not be fulfilled at that store and sends the order line back for reassignment to another store or warehouse. Order line rejection permission is granted through the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="48">Allow order reject</strong> permission.</p>
<h2 id="order-fulfillment-operation-parameters" sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="50">Order fulfillment operation parameters</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="52">Order fulfillment provides out-of-the-box parameters that can be applied to the operation when it is called in the point of sale. When the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="52">All orders</strong> parameter is configured, all orders are shown when the operation is used. The <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="52">Orders to ship</strong> parameter shows only orders that must be shipped from the store and <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="52">Orders for pick up</strong> shows orders that will be picked up in-store.</p>
<h2 id="orders-for-fulfillment" sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="54">Orders for fulfillment</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="56">The order fulfillment operation shows only orders that will either be picked up in or shipped from the current store. Orders for other stores to fulfill are not listed when using the order fulfillment operation.</p>
<h2 id="line-selection" sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="58">Line selection</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="60">Lines can be selected using the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="60">Select</strong> function in the Action Pane. When <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="60">Select</strong> is enabled, multiple lines can be selected for processing. You can clear selected lines by clicking the same line again.</p>
<h2 id="line-details" sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="62">Line details</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">Line details can be shown using the line details flyout menu. When this menu is used, three tabs are provided to show additional information for the selected line. The first tab, <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">Line details</strong> shows details for the line itself such as quantity ordered and remaining. Additional details are provided including quantity picked, packed, and invoiced as well as mode of delivery and delivery address. The <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">Order details</strong> tab provides order header information including customer, customer ID, order number, order total, and balance. The <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">Inventory</strong> tab shows information for the selected line in terms of physical available inventory, reserved inventory and ordered inventory.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">If multiple lines are selected, the order line details flyout menu will only indicate that multiple lines are selected. To show details for a single line, clear the lines until only one line remains.</p>
<h2 id="pending-order-lines" sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">Pending order lines</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Unified order fulfillment includes the ability to manually accept orders. By default, orders for fulfillment at the store are already accepted. However, if business processes dictate that a worker at the store level must accept orders, manual acceptance can be turned on at the retail store level. To enable order acceptance, go to <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Retail and Commerce</strong> &gt; <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Channels</strong> &gt; <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Stores</strong> &gt; <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">All stores</strong>. Open the desired store and on the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">General</strong> tab, locate the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Order fulfillment</strong> sub header. This sub header has a <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Manual accept</strong> option that is set to <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">No</strong> by default. By setting this option to <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Yes</strong> and synchronizing the changes to the channel database, order lines can go through the acceptance process.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="72">Workers with the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="72">Allow accept order</strong> permission can open order fulfillment and select lines for acceptance. Once lines have been accepted, their state changes from <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="72">Pending</strong> to <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="72">Accepted</strong> and the rest of the order fulfillment process can proceed. When <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="72">Manual accept</strong> is turned on, orders will not be processed until they have been accepted.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">Orders for store pickup never have the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">Pending</strong> state. This is done to avoid a scenario in which a customer arrives at the store and the order line cannot be processed because a worker with the proper privilege is not available.</p>
<h2 id="accepted-order-lines" sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">Accepted order lines</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="78">Orders with the line state <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="78">Accepted</strong> can proceed through the rest of the order fulfillment process at the point of sale. After an order has been accepted, any remaining action can be taken against the order line.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="80">For example, an accepted order line can be selected and then picked up directly without going through picking and packing.</p>
<h2 id="line-actions" sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">Line actions</h2>

<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="172">Lines shipped from unified order fulfillment are invoiced from the back office similar to if the order is invoiced directly from the back office. Lines being shipped from unified order fulfillment are not loaded into the transaction view and there is no tendering performed at the time the lines are shipped.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="174">Order lines that have been fully shipped no longer appear in unified order fulfillment. Partially shipped lines will continue to appear in unified order fulfillment until they have been shipped in full.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="176">Only lines from the same order can be shipped at the same time. If the lines from the same order have different modes of deliver, they can still be selected for shipping at the same time.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="180">Lines or partial lines can be rejected. This allows them to be reassigned from the back office to another store or warehouse. Lines can only be rejected if they have not yet been picked or packed. To reject a line that has already been picked or packed, that line must be unpicked or unpacked from the back office.</p>

<h2 id="line-quantity-tracking" sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="189">Line quantity tracking</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="191">A single order line of quantity greater than one can be processed over time, resulting in multiple sub states for order lines. For example, if a builder has a project that required 500 boards, but the builder will only pick up or have a few boards delivered at a time over the course of the project, there could be quantities that are being picked, packed, and shipped at the same time.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="193">Any time a line is selected, the remaining amount for the line will be auto-filled to assume that the remaining quantity is being processed. Using the above example, if 200 boards have already been picked and the line for boards is selected for picking, the remaining quantity of 300 will be automatically filled in the quantity. The same is true if 200 boards have already been invoiced. In that case, only the remaining quantity will be auto filled.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="195">Continuing with the above example, if 200 boards are marked as packed and shipping is selected, the full amount of 500 will be autofilled. If only 200 boards are shipped, the system will assume that the previously packed boards are being shipped and the packed quantity will be decremented. If 201 boards are shipped, the packed boards are first decremented with the remaining single board being decremented from the quantity remaining.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/Order-fulfillment-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="211">Order fulfillment at the point of sale includes filtering to help the user easily find what they need.
