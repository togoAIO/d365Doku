<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/product-lifecycle-state-transactions.md" sourcestartlinenumber="33">As an engineering product goes through its lifecycle, it's important that you be able to control which transactions are allowed for each lifecycle state. For example, products that aren't yet in a mature state should not be put on a sales order. Alternatively, if a product is reaching its end-of-life state, you might want to control the inflow of that product.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/product-lifecycle-state-transactions.md" sourcestartlinenumber="35">For an engineering product, changes to the lifecycle state are connected to the product's engineering versions. Therefore, the product's lifecycle state can also be connected to its engineering versions. When the product lifecycle state is connected to an engineering version, you can use the lifecycle state to control which transactions are allowed for the engineering version.</p>
