<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/production-control/production-floor-execution-configure.md" sourcestartlinenumber="34">Shop floor workers use the production floor execution interface to register their daily work, such as when they start a job, report feedback about jobs, register indirect activities, and report absence. These registrations are the basis for tracking progress and cost on production orders, and for calculating the basis for the workers' pay.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/production-control/production-floor-execution-configure.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">When you open the production floor execution interface, it automatically loads a selected configuration and job filter that are specific to the browser and device. In the configuration, you set the policies that must be applicable for a specific usage. Here are some usage examples:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/production-control/production-floor-execution-configure.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">
