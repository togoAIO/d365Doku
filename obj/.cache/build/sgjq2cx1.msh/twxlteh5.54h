<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/create-location-directive.md" sourcestartlinenumber="32">Location directives are rules that help identify pick and put locations for inventory movement. For example, in a sales order transaction, a location directive determines where the items will be picked, and where the picked items will be put. Location directives consist of a header and associated lines. They are created for specific <em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/create-location-directive.md" sourcestartlinenumber="32">work order types</em>.</p>

<h5>Tip</h5>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/create-location-directive.md" sourcestartlinenumber="151">If a directive code is set, the system won't search location directives by sequence number when work must be generated.

For example, multiple SKUs must be enabled for the bay door location. If you enable multiple SKUs, your put location will be specified in work, as expected. However, the put location will be able to handle only a multi-item put (if work includes different SKUs that must be picked and put). It won't be able to handle a single-SKU put. If you set this option to <em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/create-location-directive.md" sourcestartlinenumber="153">No</em>, your put location will be specified only if your put has just one kind of SKU.</p>

<h5>Important</h5>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/create-location-directive.md" sourcestartlinenumber="156">To be able to do both multi-item puts and single-SKU puts, you must specify two lines that have same structure and setup, but you must set the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/create-location-directive.md" sourcestartlinenumber="156">Multiple SKU</strong> option to <em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/create-location-directive.md" sourcestartlinenumber="156">Yes</em> for one line and <em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/create-location-directive.md" sourcestartlinenumber="156">No</em> for the other. Therefore, for put operations, you must have two identical location directives, even if you don't have to distinguish single SKUs and multiple SKUs on a work ID. Often, if you don't set up both these location directives, unexpected business process locations will come from the applied Location directive.

<h2 id="example-using-location-directives" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/create-location-directive.md" sourcestartlinenumber="249">Example: Using location directives</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/create-location-directive.md" sourcestartlinenumber="251">For this example, consider a purchase order process where the location directive must find free capacity within a warehouse for inventory items that have just been registered at the receiving dock. First, you need to find free capacity within the warehouse by consolidating with existing on-hand inventory. If consolidation isn't possible, then you need to find an empty location.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/create-location-directive.md" sourcestartlinenumber="253">For this scenario, you must define two location directive actions. The first action in the sequence must use the <em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/create-location-directive.md" sourcestartlinenumber="253">Consolidate</em> strategy, and the second should use the <em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/create-location-directive.md" sourcestartlinenumber="253">Empty location with no incoming work</em> strategy. Unless you define a third action to handle an overflow scenario, two outcomes are possible when there is no more capacity in the warehouse: work can be created even though no locations are defined, or the work creation process can fail. The outcome is determined by the setup on the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/create-location-directive.md" sourcestartlinenumber="253">Location directive failures</strong> page, where you can choose whether to select the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/create-location-directive.md" sourcestartlinenumber="253">Stop work on location directive failure</strong> option for each work order type.</p>
