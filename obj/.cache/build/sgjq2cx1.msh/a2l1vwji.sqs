<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="34">Functionality that was introduced in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations version 8.1 (October 2018) enables the reporting currency to be repurposed and used as a second accounting currency. This functionality is referred to as <em sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="34">dual currency</em>. The changes for dual currency can't be turned off through a configuration key or parameter. Because the reporting currency is used as a second accounting currency, the way that the reporting currency is calculated in the posting logic has changed.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">In addition, several modules have been enhanced to track, report, and use the reporting currency in various processes. The modules that are affected include:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">General ledger</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">Financial reporting</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">Accounts payable</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">Accounts receivable</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">Cash and bank management</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="43">Fixed assets</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">Consolidations</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="46">After an upgrade, you must complete specific steps for Cash and bank management and Fixed assets. Therefore, be sure to read and understand the relevant sections of this topic.</p>
<h2 id="posting-process" sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="48">Posting process</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="50">The posting logic has been changed for all transactions that generate an accounting entry to general ledger. Here is how the reporting currency was previously calculated:</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="52">Transaction currency amount &gt; Accounting currency amount &gt; Reporting currency amount</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="54">For example, a transaction is entered in the Canadian dollar (CAD) currency. The CAD amount is translated to the accounting currency, which is the US dollar (USD). The USD amount is then translated to the reporting currency, which is the euro (EUR). Therefore, the exchange rates must exist between CAD and USD, and between USD and EUR.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="56">Here is the new calculation:</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="58">Transaction currency amount &gt; Accounting currency amount</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="60">Transaction currency amount &gt; Reporting currency amount</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="62">Because of this change, exchange rates must now exist between CAD and USD, and between CAD and EUR.</p>
<h2 id="reports-and-inquiries" sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">Reports and inquiries</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">Various reports and inquiries now show both reporting currency amounts and accounting currency amounts. Not every report and inquiry has been updated. For example, reports that show amounts only in the transaction currency haven't changed.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">The changes follow one of two patterns:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">If the report or inquiry had enough space to show amounts in both the accounting currency and the reporting currency, the reporting currency amounts were added.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="71">If the report or inquiry didn't have enough space to show amounts in both currencies, an option was added so that users can select which currency is shown.</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="73">For various reports and inquiries, logic was also added to suppress the reporting currency amounts if the reporting currency is the same as the accounting currency, or if the reporting currency wasn't defined on the ledger for the legal entity.</p>
<h2 id="financial-journals" sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="75">Financial journals</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="77">The financial journals, such as the general journal and vendor invoice journal, have been updated so that they include additional information about the reporting currency. Totals for the voucher and journal are now shown in the reporting currency. Additionally, information about the reporting currency's exchange rate now appears on the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="77">General</strong> tab of the journal lines. Therefore, you can override the reporting currency's exchange rate when you enter transactions.</p>
<h2 id="vendor-invoices-sales-orders-and-sales-agreements" sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="79">Vendor invoices, sales orders, and sales agreements</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="80">Vendor invoices, sales orders, and sales agreements have been updated to include a fixed exchange rate for the reporting currency. A fixed exchange rate can be defined for both the accounting currency and reporting currency when the transaction currency is different. When the accounting currency and reporting currency are the same, the fixed exchange rate will be kept in sync by using the accounting currency’s fixed rate as the reporting currency’s fixed rate. The reporting currency fixed exchange rate cannot be changed for this configuration. When the accounting currency and reporting currency differ, a fixed exchange rate can be defined for both the accounting currency and reporting currency during transaction entry. If the reporting currency has not been defined on the ledger, the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="80">Reporting currency fixed exchange rate</strong> field is not enabled, and no reporting currency amount is calculated.</p>
<h2 id="module-changes" sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">Module changes</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="84">The following modules use the reporting currency as a second accounting currency:</p>

<h3 id="general-ledger" sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="94">General ledger</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="96">If a reporting currency was defined on the ledger, the general ledger already tracked reporting currency amounts on every accounting entry. However, those amounts are now translated from the transaction currency amounts.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="98">The following additional changes were made in the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="98">General ledger</strong> module:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="100">
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="100">A separate exchange rate type for the reporting currency can be defined on the ledger. If an organization doesn't want to use a different exchange rate type, you can leave the field for the exchange rate type for the reporting currency blank. Alternatively, you can select the same exchange rate type that is used for the accounting currency. If you leave the field blank, the system uses the exchange rate type for the accounting currency.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="101">A new journal, the Reporting currency adjustment journal, enables adjustments to be posted to ledger accounts in the reporting currency only. This journal enables posting only to ledger accounts. It doesn't support intercompany, and the currency must be the reporting currency of the legal entity where the journal is posted. When the journal is posted, the transaction currency and accounting currency amounts are 0 (zero), and the reporting currency amount is posted with the amount that is entered on the transaction. Because the way that the reporting currency is used in the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="101">Accounts payable</strong>, <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="101">Accounts receivable</strong>, and <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="101">Fixed assets</strong> modules has changed, this journal can be used for adjustments after an upgrade. For examples that show how this journal can be used, see the sections for those modules.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="102">The process for period allocation has been updated so that it allocates amounts in the transaction, accounting, and reporting currencies. Previously, amounts were allocated in the transaction and accounting currencies, and then the accounting currency amount was translated to the reporting currency. That behavior could cause a balance to remain on the ledger account in the reporting currency. Now, when amounts are calculated and used in the accounting entry, no translation occurs.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="103">The process for foreign currency revaluation already revalued amounts in the reporting currency. However, the reporting currency amount is now calculated through the transaction currency amount, as described in the <a href="#posting-process" sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="103">Posting process</a> section earlier in this topic.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="104">Many reports and inquiries in General ledger already had the reporting currency, but a few didn't. One example is the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="104">Trial balance</strong> list page. This list page now includes columns for both the accounting currency and the reporting currency. Note that the columns for the reporting currency are hidden if the accounting currency and the reporting currency are the same, or if no reporting currency was defined on the ledger.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="financial-reporting" sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="106">Financial reporting</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="108">An enhancement to the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="108">Financial reporting</strong> module lets you include reporting currency amounts on a financial statement in two ways. On the column definition, you can report directly on the reporting currency amounts that are posted to the ledger (new functionality). Alternatively, you can continue to translate amounts from the accounting currency to the reporting currency (existing functionality).</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="110">This change is available through the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="110">Currency display</strong> setting in the column definition. If you select <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="110">Reporting currency from ledger</strong>, amounts in the column aren't translated. Instead, they are reported directly from the general ledger. If you want the column to show translated amounts, select the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="110">Translate to XXXX</strong> option, where <em sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="110">XXXX</em> is the reporting currency that the column should show. In this case, accounting currency amounts will be translated to the selected currency by using the existing translation functionality.</p>
<h3 id="accounts-payable-and-accounts-receivable" sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="112">Accounts payable and Accounts receivable</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="114">The <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="114">Accounts payable</strong> and <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="114">Accounts receivable</strong> modules already tracked reporting currency amounts. However, the amounts weren't shown or used for various processes. The following changes were made:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="116">
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="116">Reporting currency amounts are now shown on transactions for both customers and vendors. Reporting currency amounts are also shown for the open balance of each transaction.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="117">The aging process has been updated so that an organization can view the aging buckets in either the accounting currency or the reporting currency.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="118">Various inquiries and reports were updated so that they show reporting currency amounts. Examples include the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="118">Customer to ledger reconciliation</strong> and <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="118">Vendor to ledger reconciliation</strong> reports.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="119">The process for foreign currency revaluation already revalued amounts in the reporting currency. However, the reporting currency amount is now calculated through the transaction currency amount, as described in the <a href="#posting-process" sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="119">Posting process</a> section.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="120"><strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="120">Upgrade consideration:</strong> Before an upgrade, the reporting currency amounts for documents (invoices, payments, and so on) are calculated through the accounting currency. For example, an invoice is posted before an organization upgrades, and the invoice isn't paid. During the upgrade, the invoice's accounting entry isn't changed. However, after the upgrade, the changes for dual currency are in effect. Therefore, when a payment is made for the invoice, the payment's reporting currency amount is now calculated through the transaction currency amount. When the payment and invoice are settled, a slight difference might be calculated in the realized gain/loss amount, because reporting currency amounts are now calculated differently. If the difference that is calculated is considered significant, the new Reporting currency adjustment journal can be used to adjust the balance of the realized gain/loss and Accounts payable/Accounts receivable ledger accounts in the reporting currency only.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cash-and-bank-management" sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="122">Cash and bank management</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="124">Previously, the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="124">Cash and bank management</strong> module didn't track any reporting currency amounts for transactions that were posted against each bank account. After an upgrade, reporting currency amounts are automatically tracked for any new transactions that are posted. However, reporting currency amounts must be added to previously posted transactions in the subledger.</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="126">

This wizard does <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="126">not</strong> post to the general ledger again. Instead, it takes the reporting currency amounts from the general ledger and updates them in the subledger tables.</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="128">
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="128">To start the wizard, select <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="128">Cash and bank management</strong> &gt; <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="128">Setup</strong> &gt; <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="128">Add reporting currency amounts to bank account transactions</strong>.</li>

<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="130">For each bank account transaction, the wizard finds the corresponding accounting entries in the general ledger and enters a default reporting currency amount. Although the amounts can be edited, we recommend that you <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="130">not</strong> edit them. Otherwise, you might not be able to reconcile the bank account balances to the general ledger. The only time that you should edit an amount should is if the reporting currency amount can't be found in the general ledger. In that case, the wizard will show an amount of 0 (zero) for the reporting currency.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="131">If you select <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="131">Cancel</strong> in the wizard, the bank account transactions and any changes to the reporting currency amounts are saved until the next time that you run the wizard. However, the reporting currency amounts aren't updated on the bank account transactions. That update occurs only when you select <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="131">Finish</strong> in the wizard. You can run the wizard multiple times. Therefore, you can fix any incorrect reporting currency amounts if you make a mistake.</li>

However, reporting currency amounts must be added to previously posted transactions in the subledger.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/general-ledger/dual-currency.md" sourcestartlinenumber="139">In addition, major changes have been made to the depreciation process. These changes require user action after an upgrade. It's important that you read and understand the following changes, even if you aren't yet using Fixed assets.</p>
