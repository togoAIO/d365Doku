<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/consolidate-shipments-release-to-warehouse-override.md" sourcestartlinenumber="34">This topic presents a scenario where one or more sales lines must be manually released to the warehouse from the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/consolidate-shipments-release-to-warehouse-override.md" sourcestartlinenumber="34">Release to warehouse</strong> page, and the system-defined shipment consolidation policy must be overridden before the release. An override of the shipment consolidation policy might be required if, for example, an order that isn't usually consolidated with open shipments must be consolidated with open shipments.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/consolidate-shipments-release-to-warehouse-override.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">During the scenario, you will create a set of sales orders and then override the default shipment consolidation policy before you release the orders to the warehouse.</p>
