<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/product-readiness.md" sourcestartlinenumber="33">You can use readiness checks to ensure that all the required master data has been specified for a product before it's used in transactions. When readiness checks are used, a user or team is made responsible for validating specific predefined product-related data. If there is an open readiness check for a product, the product can't be released or used in transactions.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/product-readiness.md" sourcestartlinenumber="35">The <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/product-readiness.md" sourcestartlinenumber="35">Active</strong> check box for an engineering product, variant, or version is available only after all the required data has been entered and verified, and after all the readiness checks have been processed. At that point, the product, version, or variant can be released to other companies and used in transactions. You can create readiness checks for new products, new variants, and new engineering versions.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-readiness-checks" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/product-readiness.md" sourcestartlinenumber="37">Types of readiness checks</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/product-readiness.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">There are three types of readiness checks:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/product-readiness.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/product-readiness.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41"><strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/product-readiness.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">System check</strong> – The system verifies whether there is a valid record. For example, the record might be an active bill of materials (BOM).</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/product-readiness.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42"><strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/product-readiness.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">Manual check</strong> – A user verifies whether the record is valid. For example, a readiness check might require validation of the default order settings. In some cases, such as when the product is still being designed and therefore won't be placed in stock, no default order settings are required. However, default order settings might be required for another product of the same type, because the product can be held in stock. The user is responsible for knowing how to correctly decision whether a readiness check is required.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/product-readiness.md" sourcestartlinenumber="43"><strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/product-readiness.md" sourcestartlinenumber="43">Checklist</strong> – The user answers a series of questions from a checklist, and the system determines whether the answers meet expectations. The checklist can have any subject. For example, it can be used to determine whether marketing materials or product documentation is completed.</li>
