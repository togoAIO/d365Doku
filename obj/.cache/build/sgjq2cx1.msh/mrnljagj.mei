<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/revenue-recognition-recognize-deferred-revenue.md" sourcestartlinenumber="37">This topic describes the process of recognizing revenue in the revenue recognition schedule. After an invoice has been posted for a sales order, a revenue recognition schedule is created for each sales order line that has a revenue schedule. The revenue schedule on a line is used to determine whether the line's revenue should be deferred.</p>
<h2 id="view-revenue-recognition-schedule-details" sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/revenue-recognition-recognize-deferred-revenue.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">View revenue recognition schedule details</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/revenue-recognition-recognize-deferred-revenue.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">There are two ways to access the details of the revenue recognition schedule.</p>

<li sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/revenue-recognition-recognize-deferred-revenue.md" sourcestartlinenumber="43">You can open the revenue recognition schedule directly from an invoiced sales order. In this case, the information in the revenue schedule is filtered to show the details only for the selected sales order. This approach is useful when you're validating the schedule details for a sales order.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/revenue-recognition-recognize-deferred-revenue.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">You can open the revenue recognition schedule from the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/revenue-recognition-recognize-deferred-revenue.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">Revenue recognition &gt; Periodic tasks</strong> page. This approach is often used when revenue is recognized at the end of a period. When the page is first opened, no information is shown. Use the filters above the grid to define criteria for the schedule details that should be shown. You can filter on the invoice dates by entering a date range, sales order, customer, project ID, or state.</li>

<li sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/revenue-recognition-recognize-deferred-revenue.md" sourcestartlinenumber="112">If no revenue has been recognized for the product, all the previous schedule details are removed and replaced with the new revenue schedule details. For example, item S0008 originally had 12 lines in the schedule details. Those 12 lines are removed and replaced with 24 lines, based on the new revenue schedule.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-receivable/revenue-recognition-recognize-deferred-revenue.md" sourcestartlinenumber="113">If revenue has been recognized for the product, some revenue was incorrectly recognized because recognition was based on the incorrect revenue schedule. Those lines must be reversed and recognized again, based on the new schedule. In this scenario, new revenue schedule lines are created that have negative amounts on the original recognize date. New lines are then created to recognize the amounts based on the new revenue schedule. For example, on August 8, 2019, you recognized revenue for $10.53. On September 8, 2019, you recognized revenue for $13.16. Therefore, two new lines are created on the same dates. One line is for -$10.53, and the other line is for -$13.16. Twenty-four new lines are then created, and the total deferred revenue of $160.61 is allocated across them.
