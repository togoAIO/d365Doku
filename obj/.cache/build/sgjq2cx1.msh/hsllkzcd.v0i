<h1 id="clienteling-overview" sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="32">Clienteling overview</h1>


<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="37">Many retailers, especially high-end specialty retailers, want their sales associates to form long-term relationships with their key customers. The associates are expected to know about these customers' likes and dislikes, purchase history, product preferences, and important dates, such as anniversaries and birthdays. Associates need a place where they can capture this information and easily find it when it's required. If this information is available in a single view, the associates can easily target customers who meet specific criteria. For example, they can find all customers who prefer to shop for handbags, or customers who have an important event approaching, such as a birthday or anniversary.</p>
<h2 id="client-book" sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">Client book</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce, retailers can use the client book functionality to help store associates form long-term relationships with key customers.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="43">The client book includes customer cards that show contact information for each customer, together with three additional properties that are defined by the retailer and configured in Headquarters. Retailers can decide the three most important things that sales associates should know about customers. For example, a jewelry retailer might want to include important dates such as anniversaries or birthdays, because these dates are occasions when people might buy more jewelry. Similarly, a fashion retailer might want to include the customer's preferred shopping interests and brands.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="45">The client book also lets sale associates filter the list so that it shows only customers who meet specific criteria. For example, a new collection of shoes has arrived in the store, and an associate wants to inform customers who like to buy shoes. In this case, the associate can filter the client book to find the relevant customers and then take further action.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="47">If any customers are no longer considered key customers for some reason, and therefore should not be closely managed, sales associates can remove them from their client book.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="49">Some retailers don't want to manage customers at the sales associate level. Instead, they want to manage a list of key customers at the store level. These retailers can view customers from store client books. By using this option, retailers can view the customers from the client books of all the sales associates whose address book matches the address book of the current store. In this way, if an associate works in multiple stores of the legal entity, the client book shows the customers from all those stores. This functionality supports additional capabilities. For example, customers can be reassigned from one associate to another associate. This capability is useful when associates are transferred or leave the company.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="51">Each sales associate can have one client book per legal entity, and associates can add one or more customers to their client book. In Commerce, each customer can currently be added to only one client book. However, Microsoft plans to add functionality that lets a single customer be added to multiple client books.</p>
<div class="NOTE" sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="53">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="54">Unlike customer search, the client book doesn't filter customer records based on the store's address books.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="activities-and-notes" sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="56">Activities and notes</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="58">Online channels give retailers ways to learn about customer preferences without requiring that customers explicitly provide this information. By contrast, when customers interact with sales associates in the store, they explicitly share information about their preferences. Unfortunately, this information can be lost after the sale is over. However, if this information is recorded, it can help retailers better understand customers, and therefore help them provide better recommendations and a better overall shopping experience.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="60">To capture the critical information that customers share, sales associates can use not only the client book attributes, but also use the activities and notes functionality. Retailers can configure the activity types, such as information about the store visit, email address, phone number, and appointments. Activities that associates create can be viewed in a timeline format at the point of sale (POS). They can also be viewed on the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="60">Activities</strong> tab on the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="60">All customers &gt; General</strong> page in Headquarters.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="62">Sales associates can also use notes to capture generic customer information that can be referenced before every interaction. These notes are saved in Headquarters, and can be viewed in the customer profile or on the customer details page in the call center.</p>
<div class="NOTE" sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="65">Currently, all notes and activities can be viewed by any sales associate who works for the legal entity and can view customer details pages. Notes and activities aren't limited to the associate who added a customer to the client book.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="integration-with-dynamics-365-customer-insights" sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="67">Integration with Dynamics 365 Customer Insights</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="69">By using the Dynamics 365 Customer Insights application, retailers can aggregate data from the various systems that customers use to interact with the retailer's brand. They can then use this data to generate a single view of the customer and derive insights. The integration of Customer Insights with Commerce lets retailers select one or more measures that should be shown on the customer card in the client book. For example, retailers can use the data in Customer Insights to calculate the &quot;churn probability&quot; for a customer and define the &quot;next best action.&quot; If these values are defined as measures, they can be shown on the customer card and can provide crucial information to sales associates. For more information about Customer Insights, see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/ai/customer-insights/overview" sourcefile="articles/commerce/clienteling-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="69">Dynamics 365 Customer Insights</a> documentation.
