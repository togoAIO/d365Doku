This workspace helps your vendors stay up to date about the purchase orders that have been sent to them for approval.

</div>

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/vendor-collaboration-mobile-workspace.md" sourcestartlinenumber="48">A user who signs in as a vendor will see which purchase orders have been responded to, and which purchase orders are still awaiting customer action. For example, a purchase order might be awaiting customer action because the vendor suggested another delivery date, but the customer hasn't yet agreed to that date. The vendor will also see a list of purchase orders that have been confirmed but haven't yet been delivered.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/vendor-collaboration-mobile-workspace.md" sourcestartlinenumber="50">To respond to a purchase order, the vendor must use the vendor collaboration web interface that is available in the web client. There, the vendor can also get more information about the order, such as document attachments, the delivery address per line, and charges that are associated with the vendor.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/procurement/vendor-collaboration-mobile-workspace.md" sourcestartlinenumber="52">Vendors that have a special security role can see which contact persons are registered for a vendor account.
