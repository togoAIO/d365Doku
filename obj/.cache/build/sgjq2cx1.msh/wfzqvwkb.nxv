<p sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">This topic provides an overview of the candidate-facing career site
functionality in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent: Attract. It also explains
how to set up this functionality.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">Attract provides one career site for each environment in a tenant. For example,
if an organization has a development environment and a test environment, one
career site is provisioned for the development environment, and another career
site is provisioned for the test environment. Each career site is completely
isolated and has its own authentication mechanism. Jobs and candidate profiles
aren't shared between career sites.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="49">By default, the career site is public. Therefore, candidates can view all jobs
that are marked as external without having to sign in. However, all other
actions require that candidates sign in.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="120">Azure AD sign-in is intended only for internal candidates. Therefore, it works
only for internal candidates who use their company Azure AD credentials. For
example, a candidate who is currently an employee of Contoso Ltd wants to apply
for a job in an unrelated company, Alpine Ski House. In this case, the sign-in
will be unsuccessful if the employee tries to use Azure AD
credentials from Contoso Ltd.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="127">Candidates must sign in by using Azure AD if the job that they are viewing or applying for is listed as internal only.</p>
<h2 id="create-and-maintain-a-profile" sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="129">Create and maintain a profile</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="131">After candidates sign in to the career site, they can select <strong sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="131">My profile</strong> on
the navigation bar at the top of the page to create and maintain their profile.
The profile includes personal information, information about work experience,
education details, documents, links, and information about skill sets. After a
profile is created, it can be used to apply for jobs that the candidate is
interested in. Profiles also help Attract recommend the right jobs to
candidates.</p>
<div class="NOTE" sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="139">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="140">If a candidate uses an email ID to sign in using one of the authentication providers listed above, that email ID will default to the contact email ID associated with the profile. However, the latter can be changed at any time and is completely independent of the former. Attract will always use the contact email ID to associate with your profile for all email communications.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="find-the-right-job" sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="142">Find the right job</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="144">On the job list page, candidates can search for a specific job by entering
search terms. The search functionality looks for the search terms in job titles
and job descriptions, and shows relevant jobs as results. Candidates can filter
the results at any time, based on the job location or job function.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="149">Candidates can also view a set of recommended jobs on the career site. The jobs
that are recommended to a candidate are based on the candidate's past
applications, profile, and resumes.</p>
<div class="NOTE" sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="153">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="154">Job recommendations are shown only if at least 10 jobs are posted on the career site, and if the candidate has completed a profile.</p>
</div>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="156">Internal candidates can also see who the hiring manager and/or recruiter for a job is, in case they want to contact those members of the hiring team. However, external candidates have no visibility into the members of the hiring team for any job.</p>
<h2 id="contact-the-hiring-team" sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="158">Contact the hiring team</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="159">Only internal candidates can contact the hiring team. This limitation applies to all jobs, regardless of whether they are internal only or were publicly posted.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="161">Candidates might want to contact the hiring team to express interest in a job that was posted or learn more about it. They can contact any of the hiring team members who are listed (hiring manager or recruiters). They can also optionally attach a resume to the message, or they can select an existing resume they previously uploaded as part of their profile.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="163">After an internal candidate selects the hiring team members to contact, Attract sends an email to those people on the candidate's behalf. At the same time, the candidate's profile is added to the <strong sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="163">Prospect</strong> stage, if that stage is available for the job. Under the <strong sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="163">Prospect</strong> stage, recruiters or hiring managers can view the candidates who have contacted them. They can also review candidate profiles and invite potential candidates to apply.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="165">Candidates can apply for a job that they have already contacted hiring team members about. After they apply, candidates can no longer contact the hiring team through the career site.</p>
<h2 id="apply-for-jobs" sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="167">Apply for jobs</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="169">After candidates find the right job, they can apply by using
the <strong sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="170">Apply</strong> button on the <strong sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="170">Job details</strong> page. At this point, candidates can
either create a new profile or review the information in their existing profile.
Candidates can also upload a resume, as required, and then submit the job
application.</p>
<h3 id="enable-applying-for-jobs-with-linkedin-profiles" sourcefile="articles/talent/career-site.md" sourcestartlinenumber="175">Enable applying for jobs with LinkedIn profiles</h3>

After they've authenticated, their LinkedIn profile replaces any existing profile data shown in the application page. Candidates can edit the information as needed and then submit the application. If a candidate navigates away from the page without applying for the job, their profile data is not updated in Attract.</p>
