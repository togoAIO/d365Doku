<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">This topic provides information about the process for return orders. It includes information about customer returns and their effect on costing and on-hand inventory quantities.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">Customers can return items for various reasons. For example, an item might be defective, or it might not meet the customer's expectations. The return process starts when a customer issues a request to return an item. After the customer's request is received, a return order is created.</p>
<h2 id="return-order-process" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">Return order process</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">The following illustration gives an overview of the return order process.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">Return Material Authorization (RMA) processing builds on sales order functionality. An RMA is registered as a return order, which is created as a sales order, and may have another sales order associated with it, called a replacement order. Both sales orders link to the originating RMA number.</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66"><strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">Return order</strong> – To register an RMA, you create a return order, which is a sales order that has the assigned type, <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">Returned order.</strong> Any changes that you make to the RMA information is automatically updated in the sales order. Until the return order has the status <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">Open</strong>, it will not appear in the list of sales orders. You use RMA to handle the arrival and receipt of the returned items, as well as to authorize a credit only disposition action (see section <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">Disposition codes and disposition actions</strong>). All other follow-up processes must be handled in the sales order.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="67"><strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="67">Replacement order</strong> – When a replacement order must be shipped to the customer, the RMA can include a second associated sales order. You can manually create the replacement order for the RMA to support immediate shipment. Alternatively, the replacement order can be created automatically after the arrival, inspection, and receipt are completed for the RMA line item that has a disposition code that indicates replacement. The replacement order has the same functionality that is associated with a sales order. For example, you can use it to configure a custom product as the replacement item, create a production order to repair a returned item, create a direct delivery purchase order to send the replacement from a vendor, or support other purposes.</li>

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">The return order process starts when a customer contacts your organization to return a defective or unwanted product and/or to be credited. After your organization accepts the return, the return is documented by a return order. This return order becomes the focal point of the internal processing of the returned product. The following illustration shows the procedure for creating a return order.</p>

<h3 id="create-return-order-lines" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="87">Create return order lines</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="89">After you complete the return header, you can create return lines by using one of the following methods:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="91">
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="91">Manually enter the item details, quantity, and other information for every return line.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="92">Create a return line by using the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="92">Find sales order</strong> function. We recommend that you use this function when you create a return order. The <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="92">Find sales order</strong> function establishes a reference from the return line to the invoiced sales order line, and retrieves line details such as item number, quantity, price, discount, and cost values from the sales line. The reference helps guarantee that, when the product is returned to the company, it's valued at the same unit cost that it was sold at. The reference also validates that return orders aren't created for a quantity that exceeds the quantity that was sold on the invoice.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="94">
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="94">[Note!]
Return lines that have a reference to a sales order are handled as corrections to, or reversals of, the sale. For more information, see the &quot;Post to the ledger&quot; section, later in this topic.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="charges" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="97">Charges</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="99">Fees and charges can be added to the return order through one or more of the following methods:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="101">
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="101">You can manually add charges to the return order header, the return order line, or both.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="102">Charges can be automatically added to the return order header as a function of the return reason code.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="103">Charges can be automatically added to the return order line, based on the disposition code of the line.</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="105">Charges are automatically added after a return reason code or disposition code is assigned to the line. If the reason code is changed later, the existing charge entry won't be removed, but a new charge entry might be added, based on the new reason code. When you add charges to return order lines, charges that are calculated as a percentage of the line or order value become negative when the line or line order is negative, unless the percentage is also a negative number. A charge that has a negative value represents a credit to the customer.</p>
<h3 id="return-reason-codes" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="107">Return reason codes</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="109">By applying reason codes to returns, you can help make return patterns easier to analyze. Reason codes provide information about why a customer wants to return items. Some organizations have many reason codes. These organization might group the reason codes into reason code groups to gain a better overview and for accumulated reporting.</p>
<h3 id="disposition-codes-and-disposition-actions" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="111">Disposition codes and disposition actions</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="113">An important step in the return order process is the assignment of a disposition code to the return order line as part of arrival registration. The disposition code determines the following information:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="115">
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="115"><strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="115">The financial implications</strong> – Should the customer be credited for the returned items, and should any charges be added to the return order line?</li>

</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="119">In addition to determining how the returned goods are disposed of, disposition codes can cause charges to be applied to the return line. They can also be used to group returns for statistical analysis. Disposition codes are defined as part of the setup of return orders. However, each disposition code must reference one of the built-in disposition actions. The following table lists the built-in disposition codes and their actions. <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="119">Important:</strong> If an item should not be returned, but the customer should still be credited, assign the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="119">Credit only</strong> disposition code to the return line.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="230">In up-front replacement, the replacement item can be delivered to the customer before the item is returned. This method is useful if, for example, the item is a machine part that can’t be removed unless a spare part is available to take its place, or if you just want your customer to have the replacement product as soon as possible. The up-front replacement order is an independent sales order. The header information is initialized from the customer, and the line information is initialized from the return order. You can edit, process, and delete the replacement order independently of the return order. When you delete a replacement order, you receive a message that the order was created as a replacement order. The following illustration shows the process for up-front replacement.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="248">Before returned items can be received into inventory, you must update the packing slip for the order that the items belong to. Just as the invoice update process is the update of the financial transaction, the packing slip update process is the physical update of the inventory record. In other words, this process commits the changes to inventory. In the case of returns, the steps that are assigned to the disposition action are implemented during the packing slip update. When you generate the packing slip, the following events occur:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="250">
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="250">In the warehouse, the standard process is used to perform a physical receipt.

</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="255">You can generate the packing slip only for lines that have a return status of <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="255">Registered</strong>, and only for the full quantity on the return line. If several lines on the return order have the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="255">Registered</strong> status, you can generate the packing slip for a subset of the lines by deleting the other lines from the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="255">Post packing slip</strong> page.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="257">Partial returns are defined in terms of return order lines, not in terms of return order shipments. Therefore, if you receive the full quantity that is indicated on one return order line, but you receive nothing from the other lines on the return order, the delivery isn't a partial delivery. However, if a return order line requires that 10 units of an item be returned, but you receive only four units, the delivery is a partial delivery. If not all the expected return items have arrived, you can set the shipment aside and wait for the rest of the returned quantity to arrive. Alternatively, you can register and post the partial quantity. As part of the process for posting packing slips, you can associate the packing slip reference number from the customer’s shipping documents with the order lines. This association is optional and is for reference only. It doesn't create any transactional updates.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="259">In general, you can skip the packing slip process and go directly to invoicing. In this case, the steps that you would have performed during packing slip generation are completed during invoicing.</p>

At the same time, in CompSell, the customer IC_CompBuy is defined as an intercompany endpoint that is associated with the company CompBuy. The appropriate action policy details and value mappings must be defined in both companies. In a direct delivery shipment scenario, an intercompany return order, which is also an intercompany sales order, is created in the selling company. The RMA number of the intercompany return order can be picked from the RMA number sequence in CompSell, or it can be copied from the RMA number that is assigned to the original return order in CompBuy. The RMA number settings on the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="284">PurchaseRequisition</strong> action policy in CompBuy determine these actions.

The item master price is used as the default value for the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/sales-returns.md" sourcestartlinenumber="323">Return cost price</strong> parameter. The default price differs from the cost price at the time of inventory issue. Therefore, the implication is that a loss of 3 has been incurred. Additionally, the return order doesn't include the discount that was given to the customer on the sales order. Therefore, an excessive credit occurs.</p>
