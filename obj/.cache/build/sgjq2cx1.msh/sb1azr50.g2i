<h2 id="overview" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="49">Overview</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="51">In general, the term <em sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="51">omni-channel payments</em> describes the ability to create an order in one channel and fulfill it in another channel. The key to omni-channel payment support is preserving payment details together with the rest of the order details, and then using those payment details when the order is recalled or processed in another channel. A classic example is the &quot;Buy online, pick up in store&quot; scenario. In this scenario, the payment details are added when the order is created online. They are then recalled at the POS to charge the customer's payment card at the time of pickup.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="53">All the scenarios that are described in this topic can be implemented by using the standard Payments software development kit (SDK) that is provided with Commerce. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/retail/dev-itpro/adyen-connector?tabs=8-1-3" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="53">Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen</a> provides an out-of-box implementation of every scenario that is described here.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="55">Prerequisites</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="57">Every scenario that is described in this topic requires a payment connector that supports omni-channel payments. The out-of-box Adyen connector can also be used, because it supports the scenarios that are made available through the Payments SDK. For more information about how to implement payment connectors, and about the Retail SDK in general, visit the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/retail/dev-itpro/dev-retail-home-page#payment-connectors" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="57">Retail for IT pros and developers home page</a>.</p>
<h4 id="supported-versions" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="59">Supported versions</h4>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="61">The omni-channel payment capabilities that are described in this topic were released as part of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail version 8.1.3.</p>
<h4 id="card-present-and-card-not-present-connectors" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="63">&quot;Card present&quot; and &quot;card not present&quot; connectors</h4>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="65">The Payments SDK relies on two sets of application programming interfaces (APIs) for payments. The first set of APIs is named <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="65">iPaymentProcessor</strong>. It's used to implement &quot;card not present&quot; payment connectors that can be used in call centers and with the Microsoft Dynamics e-Commerce platform. For more information about the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="65">iPaymentProcessor</strong> interface, see the <a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/e/2/7/e2735c65-1e66-4b8d-8a3c-e6ef3a319137/The%20Guide%20to%20Implementing%20Payment%20Connector%20and%20Payment%20Device_update.pdf" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="65">Implement a payment connector and a payment device</a> white paper, which covers payments.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="67">The second set of APIs is named <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="67">iNamedRequestHandler</strong>. It supports the implementation of &quot;card present&quot; payment integrations that use a payment terminal. For more information about the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="67">iNamedRequestHandler</strong> interface, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/retail/dev-itpro/end-to-end-payment-extension" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="67">Create a payment integration for a payment terminal</a>.</p>
<h3 id="setup-and-configuration" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="69">Setup and configuration</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="71">The following components and setup steps are required:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="73">
<li sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="73"><strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="73">eCommerce integration:</strong> An integration with Commerce is required to support scenarios where an order originates in an online storefront. For more information about the Retail e-Commerce SDK, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/retail/dev-itpro/ecommerce-platform-sdk" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="73">e-Commerce platform software development kit (SDK)</a>. In a demo environment, the reference storefront supports omni-channel payment scenarios.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74"><strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">Online payments configuration:</strong> The setup of the online channel must include a payment connector that has been updated to support omni-channel payments. Alternatively, the out-of-box payment connector can be used. For information about how to configure the Adyen payment connector for online stores, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/retail/dev-itpro/adyen-connector?tabs=8-1-3#e-commerce" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">Adyen payment connector</a>. In addition to the eCommerce setup steps that are described in that topic, the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">Allow saving payment information in e-commerce</strong> parameter must be set to <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">True</strong> in the settings for the Adyen connector.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="75"><strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="75">Omni-channel payments configuration:</strong> In the back office, go to <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="75">Retail and Commerce &gt; Headquarters setup &gt; Parameters &gt; Commerce shared parameters</strong>. Then, on the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="75">Omni-channel payments</strong> tab, set the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="75">Use omni-channel payments</strong> option to <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="75">Yes</strong>. In Commerce versions 10.0.12 and later, this setting is in the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="75">Feature Management</strong> workspace. Select the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="75">Omni-channel payments</strong> feature and click <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="75">Enable now</strong>.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76"><strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">Payment services:</strong> The call center uses the default payment connector on the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">Payment services</strong> page to process payments. To support scenarios such as &quot;Buy in call center, pick up in store,&quot; this default payment connector must be the Adyen payment connector or a payment connector that meets the implementation requirements for omni-channel payments.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="77"><strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="77">EFT service:</strong> Payments through a payment terminal must be set up on the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="77">EFT service</strong> FastTab of the hardware profile. The Adyen connector supports omni-channel payments scenarios out of the box. Other payment connectors that support the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="77">iNamedRequestHandler</strong> interface can also be used if they support omni-channel payments.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="78"><strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="78">Payment connector availability:</strong> When an order is recalled, the payment tender lines that are recalled together with the order include the name of the payment connector that was used to create the authorizations that are associated with that order. When the order is fulfilled, the Payments SDK tries to use the same connector that was used to create the original authorization. Therefore, a payment connector that has the same merchant properties must be available for capture.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="79"><strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="79">Card types:</strong> For omni-channel scenarios to work properly, each channel must have the same setup for tender types that can be used for omni-channel. This setup includes payment method IDs and card type IDs. For example, if the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="79">Cards</strong> tender type has an ID of <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="79">2</strong> in the online store setup, it should have the same ID in the retail store setup. The same requirement applies to card type IDs. If card number <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="79">12</strong> is set to <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="79">VISA</strong> in the online store, the same ID should be set up for the retail store.</li>

<h3 id="basic-principle-supporting-omni-channel-payments" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="84">Basic principle supporting omni-channel payments</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="86">Payment connectors and payment processors use tokens, or references, to reference interactions that are related to card payments. For example, when a payment authorization is requested, a reference to that authorization is provided. Therefore, the authorization can be referenced later, when funds are captured at the time of fulfillment. This authorization is unique to the merchant, payment connector, and processor.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="88">If an order that was created online is being picked up in the store, the same payment details for that order must be recalled and used. When the original details are provided as part of the request to capture a payment against the original authorization, the payment processor will be able to handle the request and capture the payment.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="90">To correctly reference the online order, a &quot;card not present&quot; payment connector that supports the same processor must also be available. In this way, the POS system can have one processor for &quot;card present&quot; payments, but it can also have access to other payment connectors so that it can fulfill orders that are created in other channels by using different payment processors.</p>
<h2 id="supported-scenarios" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="92">Supported scenarios</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="94">The following omni-channel payment scenarios are supported:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="96">

</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="104">Variations of these scenarios are also supported.

<h2 id="scenario-details" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="212">Scenario details</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="214">In addition to the basic scenarios that were just described, several enhancements have been made to the Payments SDK to support omni-channel payments.</p>
<h3 id="pos" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="216">POS</h3>
<h4 id="single-swipedip-for-customer-orders" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="218">Single swipe/dip for customer orders</h4>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="220">Before the omni-channel payments feature was implemented, when customer orders that included deposits were created at the POS, customers were required to swipe (or dip) their card two times: one time to pay the deposit and one time to tokenize the card for subsequent order fulfillment. When the omni-channel tokenization feature is turned on, customers must swipe their card only one time to both pay the deposit and authorize the amount that is due for goods that will be fulfilled later. At the time of fulfillment, the authorized funds are captured. Before the omni-channel tokenization feature was implemented, only a recurring card token was created for subsequent order fulfillment. Therefore, the funds for the pending fulfillment weren't authorized, and because those funds weren't being held for that specific purchase, it was less likely that they could be captured later.</p>
<div class="NOTE" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="222">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="223">Single swipe isn't supported in Retail version 8.1.3. Customer orders in version 8.1.3 use the same flow that was used before the omni-channel tokenization feature was implemented.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="cards-that-cant-issue-recurring-card-tokens" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="225">Cards that can't issue recurring card tokens</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="227">Some cards can't be used for omni-channel payments, because they don't support issuing recurring card tokens. When an order is created at the POS, if the deposit is paid by using a card that doesn't support recurring card tokens, the previous card tokenization flow is used. Therefore, a customer who wants to provide a payment that will be used for subsequent order fulfillment must present a second card. If the second card doesn't support recurring card tokens, the tokenization action will be declined, and the cashier will be prompted to ask the customer to provide a different card.</p>
<h3 id="using-a-different-card" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="229">Using a different card</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="231">A customer who comes to the store for order pickup has the option to use a different card. When the cashier receives the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="231">Use available payment method</strong> prompt at the time of order pickup, he or she can ask whether the customer wants to use the same card. If the customer has lost the card that was used to create the order and wants to pay for the order by using a different card, the cashier can select <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="231">Use a different payment method</strong>. If the customer comes back later to pick up more items for the same order, if the original card authorization is still valid, the cashier can again ask whether the customer wants to use that card.</p>
<h3 id="invalid-authorizations" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="233">Invalid authorizations</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="235">If the card that was used to create an order is no longer valid, when products are selected for pickup, the payment capture request will fail. The POS payment connector will then try to create a new authorization and capture by using the same card details. If the new authorization or capture fails, the cashier will be informed that the payment could not be processed. The cashier must then get a new payment from the customer.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-available-payments" sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="237">Multiple available payments</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="239">When an order that has multiple tenders and multiple lines is picked up, the cashier first receives the <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="239">Use available payment method</strong> prompt. If there are multiple cards, when the cashier selects <strong sourcefile="articles/commerce/omni-channel-payments.md" sourcestartlinenumber="239">Use available payment method</strong>, existing card tender lines will be captured until the balance is met for the goods that are currently being picked up. The cashier won't have the option to select the card that should be used for the goods that are being picked up.</p>
