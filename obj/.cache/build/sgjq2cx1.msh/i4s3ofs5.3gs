[!include[rename-banner](~/includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]
<p>Workers in production processes will benefit from relevant instructions that are provided at the right time in the context of their work. <em>Instructions</em> apply in several domains of work, including: assembly, service, operations, certification, and safety. Across all of these core business functions, ongoing training instructions can help empower workers to achieve more and work better.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>You can provide instructions in different ways. One efficient system that ships out of the box uses <a href="https://dynamics.microsoft.com/mixed-reality/guides/">Dynamics 365 Guides</a>.</p>
<p>Dynamics 365 Guides can help empower your employees with hands-on learning. You can define standardized processes with step-by-step instructions that guide your employees to the tools and parts they need and show employees how to use these tools in real work situations.</p>
<p>You can attach guides to various aspects of production control including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#resources">Resources</a></li>
<li><a href="#resource-groups">Resource groups</a></li>
<li><a href="#released-products">Released products</a></li>
<li><a href="#formulas">Formulas</a></li>
<li><a href="#formula-versions">Formula versions</a></li>
<li><a href="#bom">Bills of material (BOMs)</a></li>
<li><a href="#bom-versions">BOM versions</a></li>
<li><a href="#routes">Routes</a></li>
<li><a href="#route-versions">Route versions</a></li>
<li><a href="#route-operation-relations">Route operation relations</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>You can also attach Guides with Asset Management. For more information about that option, see <a href="../asset-management/asset-management-guides-integration.html">Integrate Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management (Asset Management) with Dynamics 365 Guides</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>When a first-line worker chooses a job on the shop floor through Supply Chain Management, the worker can see <a href="#logic">the relevant guides</a> on the job card. When the worker chooses a specific guide, a QR code for that guide is shown on the screen. The worker then uses their HoloLens to scan the QR code, which launches Guides and shows the required instructions.</p>
<p>The following subsections describe a few selected scenarios where companies across industries can see the biggest value when using Guides to present instructions for manufacturing.</p>
<h3 id="assembly">Assembly</h3>
<p><img src="media/instruction-guides-hero-assembly.png" alt="Use Guides in assembly tasks" title="Use Guides in service tasks"></p>
<p>Instructions in assembly operations show workers the tools and parts they need and how to use them in real work situations.</p>
<p>Production managers can create and assign Guides, for example, for <a href="routes-operations.html">production routes</a>, <a href="routes-operations.html#operation-relations">operation relations</a>, or <a href="bill-of-material-bom.html">bills of material</a>. Workers will find the relevant instructions on the respective operation experience on the shop floor.</p>
<h3 id="service">Service</h3>
<p><img src="media/instruction-guides-hero-service.png" alt="Use Guides in service tasks" title="Use Guides in service tasks"></p>
<p>Equip technicians with guided instructions at the job site, eliminating the need to schedule additional visits.</p>
<p>Service managers can assign Guides, for example, to specific <a href="../../commerce/product.html">products</a> that walk through routines of quality assessment.</p>
<h3 id="quality">Quality</h3>
<p><img src="media/instruction-guides-hero-quality.png" alt="Use Guides in quality assurance tasks" title="Use Guides in quality assurance tasks"></p>
<p>Rollout new processes and ensure increased consistency by turning employee knowledge into a repeatable tool.</p>
<p>Quality assurance managers can assign guides, for example, to <a href="../../commerce/product.html">products</a> that walk through routines of quality assessment.</p>
<h3 id="certifications">Certifications</h3>
<p><img src="media/instruction-guides-hero-certification.png" alt="Use Guides for certification related tasks" title="Use Guides for certification related tasks"></p>
<p>Ensure every employee meets high standards by quickly identifying who needs help and where.</p>
<h3 id="safety">Safety</h3>
<p><img src="media/instruction-guides-hero-safety.png" alt="Use Guides in work safety instructions" title="Use Guides in work safety instructions"></p>
<p>Provide instructions that walk through dangerous procedures virtually before attempting in the physical environment. With a mixed reality approach, workers can experience dangerous procedures virtually.</p>
<p>Production managers can provide dedicated handling instructions for hazardous material handling or delicate handling procedures by assigning instructions to <a href="../../commerce/product.html">product items</a>, <a href="routes-operations.html">routes</a>, and <a href="routes-operations.html#operation-relations">operations</a>.</p>
<h2 id="get-started-with-instructions-and-guides">Get started with instructions and Guides</h2>
<p>To enable instructions in production processes, Supply Chain Management provides an out-of-the-box integration with Dynamics 365 Guides. A licensed and installed application instance of Guides is required to build, maintain, and assign mixed reality instructions to production assets and work.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>To use this feature, your system must include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management version 10.0.15 or later</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/enable-dual-write">Dual-write</a> for Supply Chain Management apps.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/setup#step-2-create-a-common-data-service-environment-and-install-the-dynamics-365-guides-solution">Dynamics 365 Guides</a> version 400.0.1.48 or later</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="turn-on-the-feature">Turn on the feature</h3>
<p>To make the feature available on your system, you must enable its configuration keys. You only need to do this once. To do this, an administrator must do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Place your system into maintenance mode as described in <a href="https://docs.wika.com/en-us/dynamics365/supply-chain/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/sysadmin/maintenance-mode">Maintenance mode (This is an external linThis link was changed due to HTMLfromRepoGenerator)</a>.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>System administration &gt; Setup &gt; License configuration</strong>.</li>
<li>Expand the <strong>Mixed reality</strong> section and then select the <strong>Mixed reality guide</strong> check box.</li>
<li>Expand the <strong>Production management</strong> section and then select the <strong>Production instructions</strong> check box.</li>
<li>Turn off maintenance mode as described in <a href="https://docs.wika.com/en-us/dynamics365/supply-chain/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/sysadmin/maintenance-mode">Maintenance mode (This is an external linThis link was changed due to HTMLfromRepoGenerator)</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="configure-how-guides-appear-on-the-shop-floor">Configure how Guides appear on the shop floor</h2>
<p>To configure how Guides appear on the shop floor, go to <strong>Mixed Reality &gt; Dynamics 365 Guides &gt; Configure Guides integration</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="media/instruction-guides-configure-integration.png" alt="Configure Guide integration for manufacturing" title="Configure Guide integration for manufacturing"></p>
<p>Set the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft Dataverse URL</strong> - Specify the URL for the Microsoft Dataverse environment where you create your Guides. The format is &quot;contoso.crm4.dynamics.com&quot;, where the first part of the URL is typically named after your organization (such as &quot;contoso.&quot;), the second part is specific to the data region of your environment (such as &quot;crm4.&quot;), and the last part is the domain (such as &quot;dynamics.com&quot;). One way to find the right URL is to go to <a href="https://home.dynamics.com/">home.dynamics.com</a> and then open your Guides app. When Guides opens, you will see the URL in the address bar of your browser (only take the base URL, which should resemble the previous example). This value is used to compose addresses for your guides and will be encoded into the QR codes.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>QR code size</strong> - Set the size of the rendered QR code. We recommend choosing a size that will fill most of your display screen, but not more. Typically, <em>15</em> is a good value.</li>
<li><strong>QR code error correction level</strong> - Set the granularity of the QR code. Higher granularity can help increase the code's reliability, but your <strong>QR code size</strong> must be large enough to support the level of detail required by your selected correction level.</li>
</ul>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<ul>
<li>QR codes sizes that are too large for your display will take a bit longer to render and then be scaled down to fit your display. These do not provide a benefit.</li>
<li>QR code sizes that are too small may decrease the ability of HoloLens to read the code properly in some environments.</li>
<li>We recommend that you test the settings for each device that will display QR codes for HoloLens users. Choose settings that provide sufficient readability in your shop floor environment.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="get-an-overview-of-all-guide-assignments">Get an overview of all Guide assignments</h2>
<p>Use the <strong>All Guides</strong> page to see the list of all available Guides in your organization and all assignments to your production processes and resources. To open it, go to <strong>Mixed reality &gt; Guides &gt; All Guides</strong>. The list at the top shows all the available Guides and you can use the field here to filter the list. The list at the bottom shows all Guide assignments and provides a toolbar for managing them.</p>
<p><img src="media/instruction-guides-allguides.png" alt="Manage Guides" title="Manage Guides"></p>
<p>The following sections describe the types of objects that you can assign Guides to. Each assigned guide provides instructions that are automatically attached to the respective production jobs and will be available on the shop floor.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Associate a Guide to a resource</h2>
<p>Add a Guide to a <a href="operations-resources.html">resource</a> to offer the Guide in the context of relevant production jobs.</p>
<h3 id="typical-scenario-using-resources">Typical scenario using resources</h3>

<h2 id="logic">Resolving the logic for selecting Guides</h2>
<p>You can add Guides to the following production data:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#resources">Resources</a></li>
<li><a href="#resource-groups">Resource groups</a></li>
<li><a href="#released-products">Released products</a></li>
<li><a href="#formulas">Formulas</a></li>
<li><a href="#formula-versions">Formula versions</a></li>
<li><a href="#bom">Bills of material (BOMs)</a></li>
<li><a href="#bom-versions">BOM versions</a></li>
<li><a href="#routes">Routes</a></li>
<li><a href="#route-versions">Route versions</a></li>
<li><a href="#route-operation-relations">Route operation relations</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When Supply Chain Management generates the jobs for the production floor, it will collect the relevant Guides from those sources. Take note of the following important rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you attach a BOM version or formula version to a route or production order, then any Guides attached to this version, and also the Guides attached to the parent BOM or formula of that version, will be shown on the job.</li>
<li>If you attach a route version to a production order, then any Guides attached to this version, and also the Guides attached to the parent route of that version, will be shown on the job.</li>
<li>If you define several route operation relations that include the <em>All</em> relation and assign Guides to those, only the Guides from the most specific relation will be shown for the job.</li>
</ul>
