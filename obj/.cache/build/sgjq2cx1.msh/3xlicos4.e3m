<h1 id="consolidate-shipments-when-they-are-released-to-the-warehouse-by-using-automatic-release-of-sales-orders">Consolidate shipments when they are released to the warehouse by using Automatic release of sales orders</h1>


<p>This topic presents a scenario where multiple orders are released to the warehouse in the same automated release-to-warehouse periodic procedure. The orders will automatically be consolidated into shipments, based on rules that are defined as shipment consolidation policies.</p>
<p>During the scenario, you will create sets of sales orders and release each set to the warehouse. You will then review the shipments that are created or updated during shipment consolidation, based on the configured policies.</p>
<h2 id="make-demo-data-available">Make demo data available</h2>
<p>The scenario in this topic references values and records that are included in the standard demo data that is provided for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. If you want to use the values that are provided here as you do the exercises, be sure to work in an environment where the demo data is installed, and set the legal entity to <strong>USMF</strong> before you begin.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-shipment-consolidation-policies-and-product-filters">Set up shipment consolidation policies and product filters</h2>
<p>The scenario that is described here assumes that you've already turned on the feature, done the exercises in <a href="configure-shipment-consolidation-policies.html">Configure shipment consolidation policies</a>, and created the policies and other records that are described there. Be sure to do those exercises before you continue with this scenario.</p>
<h2 id="create-the-sales-orders-for-this-scenario">Create the sales orders for this scenario</h2>
<p>Start by creating a collection of sales orders that you can work with. You must work with a warehouse that is enabled for advanced warehouse (WMS) processes. Unless a different warehouse is explicitly mentioned, that same warehouse must be used for each of the following sets of orders.</p>
<p>Go to <strong>Accounts receivable &gt; Orders &gt; All sales orders</strong>, and create a collection of sales orders that have the settings that are described in the following subsections.</p>
