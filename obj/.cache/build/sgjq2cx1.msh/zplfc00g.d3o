<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">This article describes how you can use cycle counting with the warehousing solution that is available in Warehouse management. This article doesn't apply to the warehousing solution that's available in Inventory management.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">Cycle counting is a warehouse process that you can use to audit on-hand inventory items. The cycle counting process can be described in three steps:</p>

<h2 id="automatically-create-cycle-counting-work" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="102">Automatically create cycle counting work</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="103">There are two ways to schedule recurring creation of cycle counting work: set up cycle counting thresholds or set up cycle counting plans.</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="105">
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="105">A cycle counting threshold indicates the quantity or percentage limit of inventory items. Cycle counting work is automatically created when the threshold limit is reached.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="106">A cycle counting plan creates cycle counting work either immediately or periodically through a batch job. When cycle counting work is created, the counting work line includes information about the location to count. The on-hand inventory that is associated with this location isn't blocked, and is therefore available for reservation and outbound processing, even though open counting work exists.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="create-cycle-counting-work-based-on-threshold-parameters-for-items" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="108">Create cycle counting work, based on threshold parameters for items</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="110">Cycle counting work can be created when the number of items falls below a specific threshold value in a location. For example, there are 60 items in a location that has a cycle counting threshold of 40. During a sales order transaction, 25 items are picked from the location and put in a staging location. Because the new item count, 35, is less than the threshold quantity, cycle counting work is automatically created for the location.</p>
<h3 id="schedule-cycle-counting-work" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="112">Schedule cycle counting work</h3>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="114">You can schedule cycle counting plans to create cycle counting work immediately or periodically. By setting up cycle counting plans, you can control the work pool that cycle counting work is created for, the maximum number of cycle counts that are created for items in different locations, and the number of days before a warehouse location is counted again. For example, an item is available in three locations in the warehouse, and the maximum number of cycle counts is set to <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="114">2</strong>. In this case, when you run the cycle counting plan, two cycle counts are created for the two locations where the item is present. As another example, you set the number of days between cycle counts to <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="114">5</strong>. In this case, cycle counting work is created every five days. However, if cycle counting work is processed on day 3, the next cycle counting work will be created five days after the last cycle counting was processed, on day 8.</p>
<h2 id="create-cycle-counting-work-manually" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="116">Create cycle counting work manually</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="117">To create cycle counting work manually, you can use the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="117">Cycle count work by item</strong> or <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="117">Cycle count work by location</strong> page. You can specify the maximum number of cycle counts to create. For example, if the warehouse manager specifies a value of <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="117">5</strong>, cycle counting work is created for five locations, even if the item is present in 10 locations. You can also select a work pool ID to assign the cycle counting work IDs that are created to. When a work pool ID is processed for cycle counting, the cycle counting work IDs that are assigned to the work pool are processed as a group.</p>
<h2 id="perform-a-cycle-count-by-using-a-mobile-device" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="119">Perform a cycle count by using a mobile device</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="120">There are several methods for processing cycle counting work by using Supply Chain Management on a mobile device:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="122">
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="122"><strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="122">User directed</strong> – The worker can specify a cycle counting work ID that has a status of <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="122">Open</strong>.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="123"><strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="123">System directed</strong> – Supply Chain Management assigns a cycle counting work ID to the worker.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="124"><strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="124">Cycle count grouping</strong> – The worker can group cycle counting work IDs that are specific to a particular location, zone, or work pool.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="125"><strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="125">Spot cycle counting</strong> – The worker can count items in a warehouse location at any time, without creating cycle counting work. To perform spot cycle counting in a location, the worker enters the location ID.</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="127">The following example shows how you can perform spot cycle counting by using a mobile device. The instructions that the worker sees on the device vary, depending on the setup of the menu item for spot cycle counting.</p>

<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/warehousing/cycle-counting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="132">Optional: Repeat step 3 for the remaining items in the location, and confirm that no additional items are available for counting.</li>
