<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">This topic provides general information about vendor invoices. Vendor invoices are requests for received payment for products and services. Vendor invoices might represent a bill for ongoing services, or they can be based on purchase orders for specific items and services.</p>
<h2 id="vendor-invoices" sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">Vendor invoices</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">A vendor invoice from a purchase order is produced when products or services are received according to a purchase order placed with a vendor. The vendor invoice contains a header, and one or more lines for items or services. A vendor invoice completes the cycle from purchase order to product receipt to vendor invoice.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">Although some vendor invoices connect to a purchase order, vendor invoices can also contain lines that don't correspond to purchase order lines. You can also create vendor invoices that aren't associated with any purchase order. These vendor invoices might represent ongoing services, such as a utility bill. You don't have to reference a purchase order when you add an ongoing service.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">There are several ways to enter a vendor invoice:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="46">
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="46">The vendor invoice register lets you quickly enter invoices that don't reference a purchase order, so that you can accrue the expense. By using the vendor invoice approval journal, you can select those invoices and post them to the vendor balance to reverse the accrual.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="47">The vendor invoice journal lets you quickly enter invoices that don't reference a purchase order, in a single step.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="48">Together with the vendor invoice pool, the vendor invoice register lets you quickly enter invoices to accrue the expense. You can open the associated purchase orders later to post the invoice against the expense account.</li>

<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="55">When you open a vendor invoice from a related purchase order, the system creates invoice lines from the purchase order. By default, the system takes the quantities from the product receipt. However, you can use any of the following default behaviors:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="57">

The default value in the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="59">Quantity</strong> field is the physical update quantity that has been registered.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="60"><strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="60">Product receipt quantity</strong> – Use this option if a product receipt has already been received for the order.

</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="63">If your legal entity uses invoice matching, you can view the results of the quantity matching in the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="63">Product receipt quantity match</strong> column. You can also use the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="63">Matching details</strong> button on the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="63">Review</strong> tab of the Action Pane to view the results of the quantity matching.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="67">You can add a line that wasn't on the purchase order to the vendor invoice. You must select an item number or procurement category. You can then add quantities, prices, and amounts to the line. The line will be included only in matching policies for invoice totals.</p>
<h2 id="submitting-a-vendor-invoice-for-review" sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="69">Submitting a vendor invoice for review</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="71">Your organization might use workflows to manage the review process for vendor invoices. Workflow review can be required for the invoice header, the invoice line, or both. The workflow controls apply to the header or the line, depending on where the focus is when you select the control. Instead of the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="71">Post</strong> button, a <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="71">Submit</strong> button displays send the vendor invoice through the review process.</p>

<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="75">Following are several ways you can prevent an invoice from being submitted to a workflow.</p>

<h2 id="matching-vendor-invoices-to-product-receipts" sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="83">Matching vendor invoices to product receipts</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="85">You can enter and save information for vendor invoices, and you can match invoice lines to product receipt lines. You can also match partial quantities for a line.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="87">You can create a vendor invoice that is based on the product receipt line items that have been received through the current date, even if all the items for a particular purchase order haven't yet been received. For example, you might use this option if a vendor sends one invoice per month to cover all the deliveries that it shipped during that month. Each product receipt represents a partial or complete delivery of the items on the purchase order.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="89">When an invoice is in workflow, the approver can update invoice quantities so that they match the value in the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="89">Product-receipt-quantity-to-match</strong> field.

If an approver in the workflow process has removed all the matches from all the product receipts from the invoice line, the invoice line will be deleted. When this feature isn't enabled, invoice quantities are not updated for invoices in workflow.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="91">When you post the invoice, the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="91">Invoice remainder</strong> quantity for each item is updated with the total of the received quantities from the selected product receipts. If both the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="91">Invoice remainder</strong> quantity and the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="91">Deliver remainder</strong> quantity for all items on the purchase order are 0 (zero), the status of the purchase order is changed to <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="91">Invoiced</strong>. If the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="91">Invoice remainder</strong> quantity isn't 0, the status of the purchase order remains unchanged, and additional invoices can be entered for it.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-invoices-overview.md" sourcestartlinenumber="93">This option assumes that at least one product receipt has been posted for the purchase order. The vendor invoice is based on these product receipts and reflects the quantities from them.

If you must post and print multiple vendor invoices, use the invoice approval journal. If you're using the invoice approval journal, at least one product receipt must be posted for the purchase order, and an invoice for the purchase order must be posted in an invoice register. The financial information for the invoice comes from the invoice that was posted in the register.</p>
