<h1 id="set-up-the-electronic-invoicing-add-on">Set up the Electronic invoicing add-on</h1>


<p>Electronic invoicing add-on feature setup is the process of creating the required configuration through the Regulatory Configuration Services (RCS) environment and publishing that configuration to the Electronic invoicing add-on server. The setup lets you create the configurable rules that enable the Electronic invoicing add-on to use a secure protocol over the internet to communicate and exchange data with a third-party entity through web services.</p>
<p>The configurability relies on the Electronic reporting (ER) format configuration as a means to build content that is sent and received through digital files. It also relies on the orchestration of communication actions to send requests to and receive responses from third-party web services without requiring that you write code.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>&quot;The Electronic invoicing add-on feature&quot; is the generic name for the resource that is configured and published to consume the Electronic invoicing add-on server. The feature setup combines, among other things, the use of ER configuration formats to create configurable export and import files, and the use of actions and actions flows to enable the creation of configurable rules to send requests, import responses, and parse the response contents.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows the main components of an Electronic invoicing add-on feature.</p>
<p><img src="media/e-Invoicing-services-feature-setup-Overview-e-Invoicing-feature.png" alt="Electronic invoicing add-on feature overview"></p>
<p>Because of variations in invoice formats and action flows, the feature setup might vary according to country or region, or according to business requirements.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-the-electronic-invoicing-add-on-feature">Set up the Electronic invoicing add-on feature</h2>
<p>The setup process must be completed in your RCS environment. Follow these steps to create a new Electronic invoicing add-on feature.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Sign in to your RCS environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Globalization features</strong> workspace, in the <strong>Features</strong> section, select the <strong>Electronic invoicing add-on</strong> tile.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Electronic invoicing add-on features</strong> page, select <strong>Import</strong> to import the ER data model configuration from the Global repository.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Add</strong> to create an Electronic invoicing add-on feature. You can either create the feature from the scratch or derive it from an existing Electronic invoicing add-on feature.</p>
<p><img src="media/e-Invoicing-services-feature-setup-Select-Add-e-Invoicing-feature.png" alt="Adding an Electronic invoicing add-on feature"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>When you create a new Electronic invoicing add-on feature, it has a version number, and its default status is set to <strong>Draft</strong>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="configurations">Configurations</h3>
<p>Configurations hold the ER format configurations that are required for transformations and to create the files that will be exchanged during the communication with third-party web services. An Electronic invoicing add-on feature can have as many ER file format configurations as are required, based on the integration technical specification that is provided by the web service provider.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to add ER formats to the Electronic invoicing add-on feature.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>On the <strong>Electronic invoicing add-on features</strong> page, on the <strong>Configurations</strong> tab, select <strong>Add</strong> to add ER file format configurations for the Electronic invoicing add-on feature.</p>
<p><img src="media/e-Invoicing-services-feature-setup-Select-Add-e-Invoicing-feature-Configurations.png" alt="Adding Electronic invoicing add-on feature configurations"></p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>When you create an Electronic invoicing add-on feature from scratch, you must manually add all the ER file format configurations. When you derive an Electronic invoicing add-on feature from an existing feature, the ER file format configurations are automatically created, because they are inherited from the original Electronic invoicing add-on feature.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Edit</strong> to open the <strong>Format designer</strong> page, where you can edit the ER file format configuration.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>While you're editing the format, the status of the configuration version is set to <strong>Draft</strong>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Use the <strong>Format designer</strong> page to change the file format configuration. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-configuration">Create electronic document configurations</a>.</p>

<h3 id="feature-setups">Feature setups</h3>
<p>Feature setups encapsulate the rules for communication and security with a third-party web service. An Electronic invoicing add-on feature can have as many feature setups as are required, based on the business rule that you want to accomplish.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to add feature setups to the Electronic invoicing add-on feature.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>On the <strong>Electronic invoicing add-on features</strong> page, on the <strong>Setups</strong> tab, select <strong>Add</strong> to add feature setups to the Electronic invoicing add-on feature.</p>

<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p>Actions are a predefined list of operations that are run in sequential order. This list represents the breakdown of the steps that are required for full execution of the Electronic invoicing add-on feature. The actions can encapsulate, in the same Electronic invoicing add-on feature, communication in both directions: sending a request for a destination, and receiving a response and parsing its contents.</p>
<p>Each action contains a predefined list of parameters that are required for the action to accomplish its purpose. Additional parameters might optionally be provided.</p>
<h4 id="actions-fasttab">Actions FastTab</h4>
<p>On the <strong>Feature versions setup</strong> page, on the <strong>Actions</strong> tab, on the <strong>Actions</strong> FastTab, follow one or both of these steps to manage actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select <strong>New</strong> or <strong>Delete</strong> to add new actions or delete existing actions.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Up</strong> or <strong>Down</strong> to move selected actions up or down in the grid and therefore change the order that they are run in. Actions are run in the order in which they appear in the grid, from top to bottom.</li>
</ul>
