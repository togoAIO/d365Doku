<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="33">Engineering products evolve during their product lifecycle, for many reasons. For example, changes might be introduced to improve product serviceability, change a component because the supplier no longer offers it, respond to new insights, or fix mistakes in the initial design. There are also many reasons why these changes should be stored as part of an ongoing product, in such a way that previous data isn't overwritten. Here are some of these reasons:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="35">
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="35">You want to keep track of the product as it was manufactured and delivered to your customers in previous lifecycle states.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">You need a lead time before you approve and apply the changes.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="37">You want to have a timestamp on each change, and you want to be able to deliver previously manufactured products separately from each other.</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39"><em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">Engineering versions</em> ensure that the various states of a product and its data are kept current and clear, and that they can be visualized in the system. This concept helps you maintain consistency, lock down the bill of materials (BOM) for production, eliminate variability, and easily identify changes.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">Generally, the <em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="41">form-fit-function</em> rule is applied to determine whether a change requires a new product, a new version, or an update to an existing version. Each of the three terms in the name of this rule refers to a specific aspect of a part, which helps engineers match parts to needs. The form-fit-function rule increases the flexibility of design changes, because minimal documentation and design cost are required to change a part, provided that the fit, form, and function of the product are maintained.</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="43">
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="43"><strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="43">Fit</strong> refers to the ability of the part or feature to connect to, mate with, or join to another feature or part in an assembly. The fit enables the part to meet the required assembly tolerances so that it can be useful.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44"><strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">Form</strong> refers to characteristics of a part or assembly, such as the external dimensions, weight, size, and visual appearance. The form is the aspect that is most affected by an engineer's aesthetic choices. It includes the enclosure, chassis, and control panel, which become the outward &quot;face&quot; of the product.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="45"><strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="45">Function</strong> is a criterion that is met when the part effectively and reliably performs its stated purpose. For example, in an electronics product, function can depend on the solid-state components that are used, and the software or firmware. Often, it can also depend on the features of the selected enclosure. Two of the most common reasons that an enclosure can fail the function criterion are poorly placed or poorly sized ports, and misleading or missing labeling.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="engineering-versions" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="47">Engineering versions</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="49">When you use engineering products, each product has at least one engineering version. The initial engineering version is automatically created when you create an engineering product. Each engineering version stores the engineering-relevant data that is specific to that version. Here are some examples of this data:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="51">
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="51">The version number and previous version number (if applicable)</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="52">The effective-from and effective-to dates</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="53">The product version active status, which indicates whether the version can be released and used in transactions (For more information, see <a href="product-readiness.html" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="53">Product readiness</a>.)</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="54">The engineering company that created and owns the product (For more information, see <a href="engineering-org-data-ownership-rules.html" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="54">Engineering companies and data ownership rules</a>.)</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="55">Related engineering documents, such as an assembly manual, user instructions, pictures, and links</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="56">The engineering attributes (For more information, see <a href="engineering-attributes-and-search.html" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="56">Engineering attributes and engineering attribute search</a>.)</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="57">The engineering BOMs</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="58">The engineering routes</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="60">You can update this data on an existing version, or create a new version, by using an <em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="60">engineering change order</em>. (For more information, see <a href="engineering-change-management.html" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="60">Manage changes to engineering products</a>.) If you create a new version of a product, the system copies all engineering-relevant data to that new version. You can then modify the data for that new version. In this way, you can track specific data for each consecutive version. To compare the differences between consecutive engineering versions, inspect the engineering change order, which includes change types that indicate all changes.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="62">As has been stated, the initial engineering version is automatically created when you create an engineering product. The version number for this version follows the version number rule that is defined in the engineering category for the product. To transition to a subsequent version, you must add the product to an engineering change order as a line, and you must set the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="62">Impact</strong> field to <em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="62">New version</em>. The engineering change order will include the details of the change from the current version to the next version.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">Note that an engineering product can be in only one engineering change order at a time. This restriction ensures data accuracy, and helps avoid overlapping or contradictory changes in the product. Also note that the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">Engineer</strong> field in the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">Header</strong> view of the engineering change order shows the engineer who is responsible for the change order. If the engineer belongs to a team that is defined in the system, the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="64">Responsible</strong> field shows the leader of that team.</p>
<h2 id="track-versions-in-transactions" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">Track versions in transactions</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">When you use engineering change management, your product master data always includes one or more engineering versions. In your setup of engineering products, you can choose whether the engineering version is also part of <em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">logistical transactions</em>. (For more information, see the <a href="#product-category" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">Set up engineering product categories</a> section later in this topic.) If the logistical impact is relevant, it differs per product and per company. Sometimes, only the latest version of a product is used. Therefore, when you introduce a new version, the previous version can no longer be used. In other cases, the previous version is required in logistical transactions to overcome the following challenges:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">The Logistics department must ship two pieces of a product to a customer. In this case, you must decide whether you want or will allow two different versions to be shipped.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="71">It's later discovered that a problem occurs, and that it's related to a specific change. In this case, it might be beneficial to determine exactly which version was shipped in each order.</li>
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="72">Companies typically want to ship old versions first, to phase them out of inventory. Especially for low-volume products, this approach can often be managed by determining the effectivity dates of the new version in relation to predictions about when stock of the old version will be depleted. However, sometimes you might not be able to make this comparison, or you may consider the uncertainty of stock level predictions to be too high.</li>
</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">The decision about whether to make versions visible in inventory depends on factors such as those that were previously mentioned, plus company practice and other considerations that are specific to each company. You can specify the behavior for the <em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">engineering product category</em>. It will then apply to all products that are created from that category, for all companies that the product is released to.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">For products that are set up so that they have logistical impact, the engineering version must be specified on each transaction. Although the system will propose the <em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">latest active version</em>, you can select among all the active versions that are available for the company. For products that are set up so that they don't have logistical impact, the engineering version isn't specified on transactions. However, the system uses the latest active version. For example, when you add a product to a production BOM, the latest version will be used, and when you run master planning, the latest version will be assumed.</p>
<h2 id="product-category" sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="78">Set up engineering product categories</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="80">An engineering product category provides a basis for creating a specific engineering product. Each category establishes a set of default values and policies. Therefore, when you create an engineering product, you first select the category to create it from.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">Note that a new category hierarchy type (<em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">engineering product hierarchy</em>) is automatically set up for you. You can manually create the categories by going to <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">Engineering change management &gt; Setup &gt; Engineering product category details</strong>.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="84">Each engineering product category establishes the default behavior of the engineering products that are created based on that category. After you've created an engineering product, you can't change its engineering product category. However, if you select the incorrect category, you can delete the product and then re-create it.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="86">When an engineering product category is created, you're prevented from changing the following settings:</p>
<ul sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="88">
<li sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="88">Engineering company</li>

<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="95">Other settings might inherit default values that are set up for the engineering product category.

</ul>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="163">Engineering BOMs and routes are created from the engineering version where they apply. They can be recognized by the check mark in the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="163">Engineering controlled</strong> check box. When you work with engineering BOMs and routes, you won't typically design them by using different quantities. You also won't typically design different BOMs per site. Additionally, for engineering BOMs and routes, the effectivity dates are always taken from the engineering version. Therefore, an engineering version, its BOM, and its route will all have the same effectivity dates.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="165">For products where you're using the <em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="165">version</em> product dimension (together with logistical impact on the transactions), the version is also added to the BOMs and routes. This behavior helps differentiate the BOMs and routes of consecutive versions, regardless of the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="165">Enforce effectivity</strong> setting.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="167">For products where you aren't using the <em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="167">version</em> product dimension (without logistical impact on the transactions), the version isn't added to the BOMs or routes. Therefore, there will be no difference between the BOMs and routes of consecutive versions. In this case, we highly recommend that you set the <strong sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="167">Enforce effectivity</strong> option to <em sourcefile="articles/supply-chain/engineering-change-management/engineering-versions-product-category.md" sourcestartlinenumber="167">Yes</em>.
