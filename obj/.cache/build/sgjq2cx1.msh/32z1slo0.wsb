<p sourcefile="articles/human-resources/hr-compensation-process.md" sourcestartlinenumber="34">Compensation processing allows you to calculate new base compensation amounts for your employees based on equity adjustments, merit increase targets, and performance. This article covers the basic flow of compensation processing for fixed compensation plans without factoring an employee's performance.</p>
<h2 id="plan-the-new-compensation-amounts-and-budgets" sourcefile="articles/human-resources/hr-compensation-process.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">Plan the new compensation amounts and budgets</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/human-resources/hr-compensation-process.md" sourcestartlinenumber="37">To give your employees a merit increase, you must set up a fixed increase budget for each of your Departments:  Compensation management &gt; Links &gt; Merit increase targets. (Alternatively, you can open this form through the Department: Organization &gt; Departments.) Here you can further specify whether employees in a certain labor union or location should get a different increase percent. The <strong sourcefile="articles/human-resources/hr-compensation-process.md" sourcestartlinenumber="37">Budget</strong> and <strong sourcefile="articles/human-resources/hr-compensation-process.md" sourcestartlinenumber="37">Currency</strong> fields are informational and can be used to note a currency amount for the budget.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-the-compensation-process" sourcefile="articles/human-resources/hr-compensation-process.md" sourcestartlinenumber="39">Set up the compensation process</h2>
<p sourcefile="articles/human-resources/hr-compensation-process.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">A process event lets you specify the parameters for the compensation processing. This includes the date period to evaluate for determining the compensation amounts, and the date that the new compensation amounts should go into effect.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/human-resources/hr-compensation-process.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">Optionally you can include a fixed pay pro rated hire date if any of you fixed compensation plans use a hire rule of Percent. For those plans, anyone who was hired after the cycle start date and before the fixed pay pro rated hire date will receive 100% of their calculated merit or general increase. Anyone who was hired after the fixed pay pro rated hire date and before the cycle end date will receive a portion of their calculated increase based on how many days out of the total cycle days they were employed. For example, if our cycle runs from January 1 through December 31 and we have a fixed pay prorated hire date of April 1, an employee who is hired in March will receive the full calculated increase while an employee hired on July 1 will receive approximately half of the calculated increase.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/human-resources/hr-compensation-process.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">The process event <strong sourcefile="articles/human-resources/hr-compensation-process.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">Point-in-time</strong> date is used for processing only certain variable compensation plans and isn't covered here. The <strong sourcefile="articles/human-resources/hr-compensation-process.md" sourcestartlinenumber="44">Review deadline</strong> is the deadline to make all the recommendations so that the new compensation amounts can be loaded into the employeeâ€™s record. The review date is informational only.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/human-resources/hr-compensation-process.md" sourcestartlinenumber="46">After the parameters of the process event have been saved, you can click the <strong sourcefile="articles/human-resources/hr-compensation-process.md" sourcestartlinenumber="46">Setup</strong> button to indicate the plans to include when this process is run, and which fixed compensation actions to take for each plan.</p>
