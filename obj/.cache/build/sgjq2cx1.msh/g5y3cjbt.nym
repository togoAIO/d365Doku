<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/noam-usa-year-end-1099-reporting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">If you do business with vendors that are subject to United States (US) 1099 tax, you must track the amount that you pay to each vendor and report that information to the US tax authorities at the end of the calendar year. The vendors are typically individuals who aren't employees, and who provide services to your organization. You must also send a statement to each 1099 vendor that you do business with to inform them about the amount that you're reporting to the tax authorities.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/noam-usa-year-end-1099-reporting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">When you set up a vendor as a 1099 vendor, the amounts are tracked in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance throughout the year. On invoice lines, you use the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/noam-usa-year-end-1099-reporting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">1099 box</strong> and <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/noam-usa-year-end-1099-reporting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">1099 amount</strong> fields to track 1099 amounts. As you settle payments against invoices that contain 1099 information, the 1099 settled values are tracked.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/noam-usa-year-end-1099-reporting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">After you settle payments against an invoice, you can modify any 1099 amount on the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/noam-usa-year-end-1099-reporting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">Tax 1099 transactions</strong> page. Some invoice lines for a vendor might require 1099 tracking, whereas others might not. You can clear the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/noam-usa-year-end-1099-reporting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">1099 settled</strong> option for any invoice line that doesn't require 1099 tracking.</p>
<p sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/noam-usa-year-end-1099-reporting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">Additionally, you can create a new 1099 transaction that isn't associated with an invoice. On the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/noam-usa-year-end-1099-reporting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">Vendor settlement for 1099s</strong> page, select the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/noam-usa-year-end-1099-reporting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">Manual 1099 transactions</strong> option. During the calendar year, if you set up a vendor as a 1099 vendor after you've already processed transactions for that vendor, you can update the previous transactions so that they are 1099 transactions. On the <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/noam-usa-year-end-1099-reporting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">Vendors</strong> page, select <strong sourcefile="articles/finance/localizations/noam-usa-year-end-1099-reporting.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">Update 1099</strong> to update transactions.

The issuer must report the issue of the bonds or notes to the IRS within 30 days of the date of issue, by using the 1099-OID form. If the OID isn't reported, the issuer is liable for a penalty of 1 percent of the issue price, up to a maximum of 50,000 US dollars (USD).</p>
