<h1 id="set-up-interest-distribution-for-cash-accounts">Set up interest distribution for cash accounts</h1>


<p>Your agency can allocate (distribute) the interest on a bank account to specific General ledger accounts, based on the average daily balance in cash accounts. You can use this process to generate an advanced ledger entry for the interest amounts. Alternatively, you can generate the interest amounts for review, without posting them.</p>
<p>Before you distribute the interest, you must set up your participating cash accounts on the <strong>Interest distribution rules</strong> page. Each combination of a cash account and a grant can be used to calculate interest for a different interest account.</p>
<h2 id="add-a-cash-account-for-interest-distribution">Add a cash account for interest distribution</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to <strong>General ledger &gt; Setup &gt; Posting &gt; Interest distribution rules</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>New</strong> to add a row.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Cash account</strong> field, enter the cash account that contains part of the total pooled cash.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optional: In the <strong>Grant</strong> field, enter the grant for grant-related transaction amounts that should be included in cash balance calculations for the associated cash account. If all grants for the cash account post interest to the same account, you can leave this field blank. However, if you enter an interest account for a specific grant, you must enter an interest account for each grant for the cash account.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>Participate</strong> check box to include the cash accounts in interest distribution. If this check box is cleared, you can't edit any other fields in the row. Cash accounts that don't participate are included in the inquiry page so that you can review the average daily balance. However, you can't distribute interest to those cash accounts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enter either a specific interest account or a project. The value that you enter determines the General ledger account that interest is posted to for the associated cash account.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>Interest account</strong> field, enter a specific account.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Project ID</strong> field, enter a project to use as the basis for posting interest. This account is used in conjunction with other account factors to determine the complete account that is posted to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>Negative interest</strong> check box to calculate a negative interest amount when the cash account has a negative balance. If this check box is cleared, the cash account reports the interest as 0 (zero) instead of a negative amount.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The interest account for one cash account can receive any penny difference amounts when interest distribution is calculated. Select the <strong>Rounding</strong> check box for that cash account. You can mark only one cash account as the rounding account.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="distributing-interest">Distributing interest</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to <strong>General ledger &gt; Periodic &gt; Allocation &gt; Interest distribution</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Parameters</strong>, and then set the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>Total interest</strong> field, enter the total amount of interest to disburse.</li>
<li>In the <strong>From date</strong> and <strong>To date</strong> fields, select the range of dates to calculate average daily balances for, based on transactions during that date range.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Distribute</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Review the calculated interest amounts that have been distributed to the accounts. You can update the amounts in the <strong>Allocated interest</strong> field.</p>
<p>If you change the interest amounts, the <strong>Total allocated</strong> field must match the <strong>Total interest</strong> field before you can continue. The calculated interest amount might cause the total allocated amount to differ from the total interest amount. Usually, the difference is one cent. This difference is applied to the interest account for the cash account that is marked as the rounding account.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>If you change the interest amounts but then want to reset them to the calculated interest amounts, select <strong>Parameters</strong>, and then select <strong>Distribute</strong> to generate the interest by using the original data.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>To post the distributed interest, select <strong>Post interest</strong>, and then set the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>Accounting date</strong> field, enter the accounting date for the Advanced ledger entry.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Project category</strong> field, select the project category to use for the items in the Advanced ledger entry. The project category also determines the main account that the Advanced ledger entry posts to.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Posting definition</strong> field, select the posting definition to use for the Advanced ledger entry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>OK</strong>. A message shows the number of the Advanced ledger entry that is automatically created.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="calculated-amounts">Calculated amounts</h2>
<p>The interest distribution allocation process includes some calculated amounts.</p>
