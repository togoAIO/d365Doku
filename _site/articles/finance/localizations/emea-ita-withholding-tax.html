<p>This topic explains how to configure up Italy-specific settings for withholding tax and Italian withholding tax reports.</p>
<p>For Italy, there is a country-specific legal requirement that a buyer withhold a tax amount from some types of vendor payments, such as payments to self-employed vendors. The company must then remit the tax to the tax authority. Withholding tax is a tax that is withheld from the payment amount for vendor invoices. This topic describes Italy-specific settings for withholding tax and the following Italian reports: <strong>Withholding tax - certification</strong>, <strong>Withholding tax - monthly</strong>, and <strong>Withholding tax - yearly</strong>. Set up withholding tax codes at <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Indirect taxes</strong> &gt; <strong>Withholding tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Withholding tax codes</strong>. Define standard settings on the <strong>General</strong> and <strong>Calculation</strong> FastTabs. On the <strong>Italian reporting</strong> FastTab, define the following settings.</p>

<p>To run the Italy-specific reports about withholding tax, go to <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Inquiries and reports</strong> &gt; <strong>Withholding tax reports</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Withholding tax - certification</strong> - This report is used to print an Italian certification report in the withholding tax currency. The report is intended to be sent to the vendor. It includes withholding tax data for the specified period. The report certifies to the vendor that tax amounts were withheld during the report period.</li>
<li><strong>Withholding tax - monthly</strong> - This report is used to print, for each vendor account, details of the withholding tax amounts for all invoices that were paid during a month: the withholding tax reason code, total amount, base excluded amount, not taxable amount by treaty, not taxable amount, taxable base, and withholding tax amount. If the user selects to print details in the dialog box, the report shows amount details by document date and invoice number.</li>
<li><strong>Withholding tax - yearly</strong> - This report is used to print, for each vendor account, the resulting withholding tax amounts. These amounts are grouped by withholding tax code and details are included by invoice. Depending on the <strong>Source</strong> and <strong>May be reported by recipient</strong> settings on the withholding tax code, the report also shows total amounts: total amounts that the recipient can or can't report, and total amounts of source withholding tax or withholding tax in advance.</li>
