<h1 id="partial-fixed-asset-disassembly-liquidation">Partial fixed asset disassembly (liquidation)</h1>


<p>Partial disassembly (liquidation) of fixed asset objects can cause the original value of the asset to change, in accordance with Russian Federation law (PBU 6/01). The components that are removed for disassembly can be accounted for as spare parts. The inventory that remains after the disposal of an asset is posted at its actual cost price. This price is based on the current market value of the inventory on the date of posting to accounting.</p>
<h2 id="configure-transaction-profiles">Configure transaction profiles</h2>
<p>To create the partial fixed asset disassembly transactions, you must configure the transaction profiles.</p>

<h2 id="calculating-prices">Calculating prices</h2>
<p>This section contains examples and mathematical equations (formulas). Two methods are used to calculate the price of an asset. By default, the depreciated cost of a component is adopted as the cost value.</p>
<h3 id="the-proportional-method">The proportional method</h3>
<p>The fixed asset revaluation transaction includes all components in proportion to their original value. The acquisition date of the component isn't considered. The acquisition date of the component isn't considered.</p>
<p>For every component that is withdrawn from the fixed asset composition, the balance of the component (S<sub>j</sub>) is calculated by using the following formula:</p>
<p>S<sub>j</sub> = S<sub>bal</sub> × (S<sub>j,PIO</sub> ÷ S<sub>PIO</sub>)</p>
<p>Here is an explanation of this formula:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>S<sub>bal</sub></strong> – The fixed asset balance value. This value is calculated as the sum of acquisition transactions, revaluation transactions, major refurbishment transactions, and partial take-down transactions. Partial take-down transactions have a negative sign and are automatically deducted from the total.</li>
<li><strong>S<sub>j,PIO</sub></strong> – The original value of withdrawn components.</li>
<li><strong>S<sub>PIO</sub></strong> – The original fixed asset cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>The accumulated depreciation for components (A<sub>j</sub>) is calculated in the same way as the original value where the following condition is true:</p>
<p>A<sub>j</sub> = A<sub>bal</sub> × (S<sub>j,PIO</sub> ÷ S<sub>PIO</sub>)</p>
<p>Here is an explanation of this formula:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A<sub>bal</sub></strong> – The fixed asset value depreciation. This value is calculated as the sum of all transactions that are used to calculate fixed asset depreciation, fixed asset depreciation revaluation transactions, and partial dismantlement transactions. The calculated value is rounded according to the configuration of Fixed assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The depreciated cost of components is calculated as the difference between the component balance value and the accumulated component depreciation.</p>
<p>The following example shows how the component balance value is calculated.</p>

<p>* At the time of partial fixed asset disassembly (transaction 7), the following conditions are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fixed asset balance value is 1,000 + 2,000 + 1,500 + 2,500 = 7,000.</li>
<li>The original cost is 1,000 + 2,000 + 2,500 = 5,500.</li>
<li>The fixed asset balance depreciation is 300 + 700 = 1,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the balance value of component item 1 is 7,000 × (1,000 ÷ 5,500) = 1,272.73, and the accumulated depreciation for component item 1 is 1,000 × (1,000 ÷ 5,500) = 181.82.</p>
<p>Here is the balance value of the component after transactions 1 through 7 are completed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Item 1:</strong> 1,272.73 (The component was disposed of by using the specified original cost.)</li>
<li><strong>Item 2:</strong> 2,545.45</li>
<li><strong>Item 3:</strong> 3,181.82</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the accumulated component depreciation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Item 1:</strong> 181.82 (The component was disposed of by using the specified accumulated depreciation.)</li>
<li><strong>Item 2:</strong> 363.64</li>
<li><strong>Item 3:</strong> 454.54</li>
</ul>
<p>After transactions 1 through 9 are completed, the fixed asset balance value is 1,000 + 2,000 + 1,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 – 1,272.73 = 7,727.27.</p>
<p>The accumulated fixed asset depreciation is 700 + 300 + 349.21 – 181.82 = 1,167.39.</p>
<p>The original cost is 2,000 + 2,500. (At the time of calculation, the fixed asset consists of only component item 2 and component item 3.)</p>
<p>Here is the balance value:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Item 2:</strong> 7,727.27 × (2,000 ÷ [2,000 + 2,500]) = 3,434.34</li>
<li><strong>Item 3:</strong> 7,727.27 × (2,500 ÷ [2,000 + 2,500]) = 4,292.93</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the accumulated component depreciation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Item 2:</strong> 1,167.39 × (2,000 ÷ [2,000 + 2,500]) = 518.84</li>
<li><strong>Item 3:</strong> 1,167.39 × (2,500 ÷ [2,000 + 2,500]) = 648.55</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-iterate-method">The iterate method</h3>
<p>The fixed asset revaluation transaction doesn't revalue all components in proportion to their original value, but only in proportion to the value of the components that are included at the time of the revaluation transaction.. Furthermore, the proportional distribution method remains in effect.</p>
<p>Therefore, for every component that is subject to withdrawal from the fixed asset composition, a table is created that includes all revaluation transactions. Major refurbishments are calculated after the component is acquired. The following table uses item 2 as an example.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>i</th>
<th>Revaluation amount, Adj(i)</th>
<th>Fixed asset balance value before revaluation, S<sub>bal</sub>(i)</th>
<th>Original component cost, S<sub>src</sub>(i)</th>
<th>Cost after revaluation, S<sub>dst</sub>(i)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1,500</td>
<td>3,000</td>
<td>2,000</td>
<td>S<sub>dst</sub>(i) = S<sub>src</sub>(i) × (1 + [Adj(i) ÷ S<sub>bal</sub>(i)]) = 3,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>2,000</td>
<td>5,500*</td>
<td>S<sub>src</sub>(i) = S<sub>dst</sub>(i–1) = 3,000</td>
<td>S<sub>dst</sub>(i) = S<sub>src</sub>(i) × (1 + [Adj(i) ÷ S<sub>bal</sub>(i)]) = 4,090.91</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>* The fixed asset balance value that is calculated includes the fixed asset revaluation amount that is caused by a partial disassembly of the asset.</p>
<p>Here is an explanation of the table:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adj(i)</strong> – The cost of the current revaluation transaction.</li>
<li><strong>S<sub>bal</sub>(i)</strong> – The fixed asset balance value before revaluation. This value is calculated as the sum of all acquisition transactions before the current revaluation transaction, plus the sum of all revaluation transactions before the current revaluation transaction and all major refurbishment transactions, minus the previous partial fixed asset disassembly transactions.</li>
<li><strong>S<sub>src</sub>(i)</strong> – The original component cost. For a first revaluation, this value is set to the cost of acquiring the components. For example, if 10 units were acquired, and five must be withdrawn, this sum includes the original cost value of five units. For all subsequent transactions, this sum is initialized from the S<sub>dst</sub>(i-1) value.</li>
</ul>
<p>The calculated value is rounded according to the configuration of Fixed assets.</p>
<p>In the example, the component balance value is 3,000 after revaluation transaction 1 and 4,090.91 after revaluation transaction 2.</p>
<p>Calculation of the added component depreciation is similar to the calculation of the balance value. In this case, the depreciation revaluation transactions and depreciation accrual transactions are identical to the revaluation transaction.</p>
<p>A table is created for every component that is withdrawn from the fixed asset composition. The lines of the table include all depreciation accrual and depreciation revaluation transactions that were completed after acquisition, except depreciation revaluation transactions that were triggered by disassembly transactions. See the following table.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>i</th>
<th>Depreciation or revaluation amount, Acq(i)</th>
<th>Fixed asset balance value at the time of depreciation or depreciation revaluation</th>
<th>Component cost, S<sub>dst</sub>(i)</th>
<th>Depreciation after revaluation, A(i)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>300 (depreciation)</td>
<td>4,500</td>
<td>3,000</td>
<td>A(i) = A(i–1) + S<sub>dst</sub>(i) × (Acq(i) ÷ S<sub>bal</sub>) = 200</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>700 (depreciation)</td>
<td>7,000</td>
<td>3,000</td>
<td>A(i) = A(i–1) + S<sub>dst</sub>(i) × (Acq(i) ÷ S<sub>bal</sub>) = 500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>349.21 (revaluation)</td>
<td>5,500</td>
<td>3,000</td>
<td>A(i) = A(i–1) + S<sub>dst</sub>(i) × (Acq(i) ÷ S<sub>bal</sub>) = 690.48</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For the first depreciation line, the value A(i–1) equals 0 (zero).</p>
<p>The calculation of accumulated component depreciation is based on the component balance value that is calculated. The balance value calculation can be combined with the depreciation calculation. Additionally, a general transaction table can be created, and the required steps can be performed, depending on the type of the next transaction.</p>
<p>The component depreciated cost is calculated as the difference between the component balance value that is calculated and the accumulated component depreciation.</p>
<p>A partial take-down transaction has an indirect effect on the fixed asset balance. A partial take-down transaction creates value and depreciation revaluation transactions. These transactions, in turn, are already considered in the fixed asset balance.</p>
<p>As a result of the calculation, a balance value, a balance depreciation, and a market value that equals the depreciated cost are created.</p>
