<p>The topic describes how to set up and use Italian sales tax books and Italian sales tax book sections.</p>
<p>According to Italian fiscal legislation, every value-added tax (VAT) transaction must belong to a tax book (<em>Libro IVA</em>) that will be used for tax reporting. To fulfill these legislative requirements, Dynamics 365 Finance implements Italian sales tax books. Sales tax books can be of different types. You must specify the sales tax book type to help guarantee that all sales and purchase transactions are included on the <strong>Italian sales tax payment</strong> report. You can keep as many sales tax books of the <strong>Sales</strong> and <strong>Purchase</strong> types as you require. Every tax book can be divided into multiple tax book sections (<em>Sezionale IVA</em>). All sales tax transactions must be sequentially numbered (without gaps) and ordered by posting date. A tax book section is equivalent to a number sequence for the Italian sales tax voucher number (<em>Protocollo IVA</em>) that must always be applied during posting to help guarantee chronological order by posting date.</p>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Setup:</strong> Number sequences</td>
<td>Set up as many number sequences as you require to cover all the required types of sales tax transactions. (Click <strong>Organization administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Number sequences</strong> &gt; <strong>Number sequences</strong>.) All these number sequences must be continuous and must have <strong>Company</strong> scope.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Setup:</strong> Journal names</td>
<td>Set up the required journal names. (Click <strong>General Ledger</strong> &gt; <strong>Journal setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Journal names</strong> or <strong>Project management and accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Journals</strong> &gt; <strong>Journal names</strong>.) On the <strong>General</strong> FastTab, in the <strong>Sales tax</strong> section, in the <strong>Italian sales tax book</strong> field, specify one of the following values:
<ul>
<li><strong>Not included</strong> – Select this value for invoices and credit notes that come from countries/regions that are outside the European community.</li>
<li><strong>Purchase</strong> – Select this value for purchase invoices and credit notes.</li>
<li><strong>Sales</strong> – Select this value for sales invoices and credit notes.</li>
<li><strong>Empty</strong> – Select this value for all other types of transactions.</li>
</ul>
In some cases, the <strong>Italian sales tax book</strong> field is set automatically, based on the <strong>Journal type</strong> value. For example, if the <strong>Journal type</strong> field is set to <strong>Invoice register</strong>, the <strong>Italian sales tax book</strong> field is set to <strong>Purchase</strong> by default.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Setup:</strong> Module parameters</td>
<td>For vouchers to follow the number sequences of the related invoices and credit notes, you must select the <strong>Reuse numbers</strong> check box when you define the number sequences for those invoices and credit notes. You can find this check box on the <strong>Number sequences</strong> tab of the following pages:
<ul>
<li>Accounts receivable parameters</li>
<li>Accounts payable parameters</li>
<li>Project management and accounting parameters</li>
</ul>
For example, on the <strong>Accounts receivable parameters</strong> page, on the <strong>Number sequences</strong> tab, select the <strong>Reuse numbers</strong> check box for <strong>Free text invoice voucher</strong> to synchronize number allocation for free text invoice vouchers and free text invoices.
<p>In the Italian localization, corrections to the Italian sales tax payment report for an already settled sales tax period are not supported. So on the <strong>General ledger parameters</strong> page, on the <strong>Sales tax</strong> tab, set the Special report <strong>Include corrections</strong> option to <strong>NO</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="using-sales-tax-books">Using sales tax books</h2>
<p>When the setup is completed, the sales tax book sections appear on the <strong>Number sequences</strong> tab of the following pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounts receivable parameters</li>
<li>Accounts payable parameters</li>
<li>Project management and accounting parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>Voucher numbers that are assigned during posting must be sequentially ordered by posting date, and the sales tax transactions that use the same number sequence code must be posted in order. If the voucher numbers aren't sequentially ordered, the user receives an error message. In addition, posting is interrupted if a sales tax transaction isn't assigned to any sales tax book section when the user updates an invoice. Whenever a voucher is posted through a sales tax book section, the identifiers of the related sales tax book and sales tax book section are saved in the tax transactions. (Click <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales tax inquiries</strong> &gt; <strong>Posted sales tax</strong>, and then click the <strong>Posting</strong> tab.) This data can then be used during further sales tax reporting. Italian sales tax books are used for filtering, grouping, and sorting on the report that is accessed at <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Declarations</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales Tax (Italy)</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="additional-information">Additional information</h2>
<p>Due to the fiscal requirements of sequential document numbering and how this information is used in the sales tax books, users in Italy should not have access to the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reverse customer transaction (<strong>All customers</strong> page, select <strong>Transactions</strong> &gt; <strong>Reverse</strong>)</li>
<li>Reverse vendor transaction (<strong>All vendors</strong> page, select <strong>Transactions</strong> &gt; <strong>Reverse</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>These functions must be hidden using the functionality of Privileges.
