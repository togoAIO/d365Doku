<p>You can set up a dual-write connection between a Finance and Operations environment and a Dataverse environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>Finance and Operations environment</strong> provides the underlying platform for <strong>Finance and Operations apps</strong> (for example, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, Dynamics 365 Commerce, and Dynamics 365 Human Resources).</li>
<li>A <strong>Dataverse environment</strong> provides the underlying platform for <strong>customer engagement apps</strong> (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 column Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation).</li>
</ul>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>The Human Resources module in Dynamics 365 Finance supports dual-write connections, but the Dynamics 365 Human Resources app doesn't.</p>
</div>
<p>The setup mechanism varies, depending on your subscription and the environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>For new instances of Finance and Operations apps, the setup of a dual-write connection begins in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). If you have a license for Microsoft Power Platform, you will get a new Dataverse environment if your tenant doesn't have one.</li>
<li>For existing instances Finance and Operations apps, the setup of a dual-write connection begins in the Finance and Operations environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you start dual-write on an entity, you can run an initial synchronization to handle existing data on both sides: Finance and Operations apps and customer engagement apps. You can skip the initial synchronization if you don't have to sync data between the two environments.</p>
<p>An initial synchronization lets you copy existing data from one app to another bidirectionally. There are several setup scenarios, depending on the environments that you already have and the type of data in them.</p>
<p>The following setup scenarios are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#new-new">A new Finance and Operations app instance and a new customer engagement app instance</a></li>
<li><a href="#new-existing">A new Finance and Operations app instance and an existing customer engagement app instance</a></li>
<li><a href="#new-data-new">A new Finance and Operations app instance that has data and a new customer engagement app instance</a></li>
<li><a href="#new-data-existing">A new Finance and Operations app instance that has data and an existing customer engagement app instance</a></li>
<li><a href="#existing-new">An existing Finance and Operations app instance and a new customer engagement app instance</a></li>
<li><a href="#existing-existing">An existing Finance and Operations app instance and an existing customer engagement app instance</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-new">A new Finance and Operations app instance and a new customer engagement app instance</h2>
<p>To set up a dual-write connection between a new instance of a Finance and Operations app that has no data and a new instance of a customer engagement app, follow the steps in <a href="lcs-setup.html">Dual-write setup from Lifecycle Services</a>. When the connection setup is completed, the following actions automatically occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new, empty Finance and Operations environment is provisioned.</li>
<li>A new, empty instance of a customer engagement app is provisioned, where the CRM prime solution is installed.</li>
<li>A dual-write connection is established for DAT company data.</li>
<li>Table maps are enabled for live synchronization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both environments are then ready for live data synchronization.</p>
