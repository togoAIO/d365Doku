<p>The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources app in Microsoft Teams lets you quickly request time off and view your time-off balance information right in Microsoft Teams. You can interact with a bot to request information and start a leave request. The <strong>Time off</strong> tab provides more detailed information. You can also send people information about your upcoming time off in teams and chats outside the Human Resources app.</p>

<h3 id="microsoft-language-understanding-intelligent-service-luis">Microsoft Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS)</h3>
<p>With the Dynamics 365 Human Resources bot in Microsoft Teams, the user’s text inputs are analyzed for understanding the underlying query/intent. The user’s input such as “Search account Contoso” is routed to one of Microsoft’s Cognitive Service called Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS). Read more about LUIS <a href="https://www.luis.ai/">here</a>. The LUIS service disambiguates or understands the intent of user input (in this case, the intent is to find information) and the target entity (in this case, the intended entity is an account named Contoso). This information is then passed on to Microsoft’s <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/bot-service/">Azure bot framework</a>, which interacts with data from Dynamics 365 Human Resources and retrieves the desired information for the user query.</p>
<p>By installing and allowing access to use of the bot, you agree to allow the LUIS service and Azure bot framework to process the intent behind the input,  which results in an enhanced conversational user experience. The LUIS service and Azure bot framework may have varying levels of compliance compared to Dynamics 365 Human Resources. While the LUIS service has access to only the user queries and is not designed to be connected to the user’s Dynamics 365 Human Resources data or account, a user of the Dynamics 365 Human Resources bot could voluntarily enter a query containing Customer Data, Personal Data, or other data and such query content could get sent to the LUIS service and the Azure bot framework.</p>
<p>The content of user’s queries and messages is retained in LUIS system for a maximum of 30 days, is encrypted at rest, and is not used for training or service improvement. Read more about Cognitive Services <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/language-understanding-intelligent-service/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="microsoft-teams-azure-event-grid-and-azure-cosmos-db">Microsoft Teams, Azure Event Grid, and Azure Cosmos DB</h3>
<p>When using the Dynamics 365 Human Resources app in Microsoft Teams, certain customer data may flow outside of the geographic region where your tenant’s Human Resources service is deployed.</p>
<p>Dynamics 365 Human Resources transmits the employee’s leave request and workflow task details to Microsoft Azure Event Grid and Microsoft Teams. This data may be stored in Microsoft Azure Event Grid for up to 24 hours and will be processed in the United States, is encrypted in transit and at rest, and is not used by Microsoft or its subprocessors for training or service improvements. To understand where your data is stored in Teams, please see: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/location-of-data-in-teams?view=o365-worldwide&amp;preserve-view=true">Location of data in Microsoft Teams</a>.</p>
<p>While conversing with the chat bot in the Human Resources app, the conversation content may be stored in Azure Cosmos DB and transmitted to Microsoft Teams. This data may be stored in Azure Cosmos DB for up to 24 hours and may be processed outside of the geographic region where your tenant's Human Resources service is deployed, is encrypted in transit and at rest, and is not used by Microsoft or its subprocessors for training or service improvements. To understand where your data is stored in Teams, please see: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/location-of-data-in-teams?view=o365-worldwide&amp;preserve-view=true">Location of data in Microsoft Teams</a>.</p>
