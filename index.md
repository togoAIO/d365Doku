# Welcome to the docmentation of the WIKA ERP-Systems D365

On this website you will find the user documentation of the ERP system D365.

We would like to provide you with a fully comprehensive documentation of the new ERP system D365. This documentation is web-based and can be accessed by any WIKA employee. This form of documentation is intended to replace the previous manuals. In part, we will use the standard documentation from Microsoft; for the most part, we will describe our system ourselves.

In the past systems (Ax 2009 and AX 2012) there were always problems with the completeness of the documentation, because often only the individual masks (windows) were described and the connections were not apparent. From an IT point of view, we understand interrelationships to mean the "click paths" or holistic procedures (processes) such as the standard order process (SOP = Standard Order Process).

Therefore, the documentation is structured process- and module-related.

Process-related means that complete processes ("click paths") such as "material transfer" are documented across different application screens and from different views. In this way, it is possible to completely describe everything that has to be done from different perspectives. Let's take the process of material transfer again. Material is needed in production. Here a demand arises. The system creates a demand cover, which is displayed in the warehouse. Num the material is taken from the warehouse and booked out of the warehouse. In this process several D365 masks and different departments are involved. These can be mapped holistically through a process-related documentation approach.

In addition, the documentation is module-related. This means that the individual departments find descriptions of their work content.
